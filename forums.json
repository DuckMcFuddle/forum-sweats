[{"title": "Regarding recent wipes from a few recent ban waves (July 15th)", "body": "Recently we have been banning and wiping quite a few accounts and profiles as you've noticed. While this is an important move for the health of this community, sadly, some of our most recent waves have been a bit too harsh and some players have been affected that shouldn't have.\n\nWe've noticed that our system went at it the wrong way - it would ban all profiles on players who were caught boosting, then spread itself to all profiles this person was a part of, then spread itself further to all profiles people in affected coops were a part of. As one may obviously guess, that's way more bans than there should have been.\n\nThis morning, we undid a lot of the bans and wipes that went out in the last few days - just a quick reset. Please note that this does not mean that all of these were false - we're just starting over. In the next few days, expect some of these bans and wipes to come back.\n\nPlease note that we had warned everyone back in January that boosting was against our rules and that we would take action.

Each of them radiated an immense, godly aura, an aura that would make most people cower in fear. \n\u201cSurrender,\u201d the first man said.\n\u201cNo\u201d\nJayavarmen did not expect that to work, of course. He did not believe that a man who worked so hard and took so many lives to get to this point would surrender, no matter how strong the opponent was. A clash was inevitable. No matter what happened, one of them would not be getting out alive. \n\n\u201c[Mythical Creation: Death\u2019s Blade]\u201d\n\nMort summoned his blade. Jayaverman countered by summoning his own blade [Blade of Creation]. Both swords had extremely similar abilities. They would allow the user to add abilities from other weapons onto the sword. However, [Death\u2019s Blade] had a higher melee stat, where [Sword of Creation] had a higher magic damage stat. The difference was minimal though, and would not make a difference in a battle of two equal strengths. \n\n\u201c[Apply Debuff: Nerf]\u201d\n\nThe battle started with Jayavermen casting a spell. The [Nerf] debuff would reduce the opponents stats greatly for a short period of time. This effect was very powerful, so the spell had a long cooldown to compensate.\n\n\u201c[Judgement of the Council]\u201d\n\nUndead rose from the ground in a great quantity, forcing Jayaverman to cancel his spell. [Judgement of the Council] would summon the undead council to force the opponent to cancel whatever spell they had used.\n\n\u201c[Item Ability: Ice Bolt]\u201d\n\u201c[Item Ability: Dreadlord Skull]\u201d\n\nA ice shard and a wither skull crashed against each other, resulting in a small explosion. Neither person took damage though, as the abilities cancelled each other out.\n\n\u201c[Item Ability: Army of the Dead]\u201d\n\n\u201c[Item Ability: Burning Vortex]\u201d\n\nAn army of dead appeared, but a massive tornado of flame wiped it out at nearly the same time. \n\n\u201c[Item Ability: Acupuncture]\u201d\n\u201c[Item Ability:Iron Punch]\u201d\nA storm of needles surrounded Jayaverman, plunging towards him. However, the magic waves from [Iron Punch] knocked them all down.\n\nThe battle could not continue like this. While [Item Abilities] were instant-cast, they spent a lot of mana. The two had used a variety of mana-intensive abilities, and were now relatively low on mana. Mort rushed toward Jayaverman, and their two swords met. Mort used [Teleport] to get behind Jayavarman, but Jayaverman, expecting this, dodged to the right. Jayaverman turned around and rushed toward Mort, their swords clashing once more.\n\n\u201c[Divine Judgement]\u201d\n\u201c[Eternal Death]\u201d\n\nThe two extremely powerful spells were exact opposites of each other, causing a large explosion when they met. The explosion forced both people back quite a distance away from each other. They rushed toward each other, swords meeting once again.\n\nThey exchanged blows for quite a while, until finally, Jayaverman had regenerated all his mana. Mort also had relatively high mana, so he used one of his trump cards, [Chaotic Death]. This one spell had consumed about half of Mort\u2019s mana and had dealt a large amount of damage to Jayaverman, who was now at about 25% Health, having also lost quite a bit from their previous exchange of blows.\n\nHowever, [Chaotic Death] had a long ending lag, and Jayarverman took advantage of that to cast his final trump card, [Will of the Creator]. This spell would use all of Jayarverman\u2019s mana to summon a powerful bolt that on hitting the opponent, would cause instant death. This bolt was extremely hard to hit, but because Mort was currently in the ending lag of [Chaotic Death], he could not dodge it. \n\nRight before he died, Mort casted [Sacrificial Reincarnation], which in exchange for his life and power, would allow him to reincarnate in a couple hundred years.\n\nThe battle had ended, Jayaverman had won. Until Mort reincarnated, the victory was Jayavermans."}, {"title": "[POLL] Skyblock should not be pay to win", "body": "I would quit if it does."}, {"title": "Hejhopki, hejhopki!

Each challenge and achievement will have a different level. That level will depend on the amount of tributes you earn. For Example:\n\nLevel 1 = 1 tributes \nLevel 2 = 2 tributes\nLevel 3 = 3 tributes\n\nAlso leveling up skills on that profile will give you a tribute\nChallenge examples\nA level 1 Challenge will be like --- Get 3 stacks of oak wood\nA level 2 Challenge will be like --- Collect 50 fairy souls\nA level 3 challenge will be like --- Get each skill to level 10\n\nRewards\u200bWith your tributes you have earned through out this tournament you will be able to buy items from the tournament store. Items will be such as:\n50 tributes = An hour level 3 skill pots such as Farming, combat and Mining\n100 tributes = A epic random pet\n200 tributes = A random Legendary pet\n500 tributes = 1 mil skill xp on any skill of your choice\n\n\nHopefully you liked this idea.

organized it based on this website here.)\n\nPrivate Island:\n\nJerry.\nBiggest meme in skyblock, owns a factory with infinite mobs including snowball spamming snowmen, super compact reappearing presents, weak villager clones who can't protect themselves from fire cubes that appear annually, a broken down ice cave game which has been under maintenance for months, and he gets away with duping jerry eggs and himself.\n\nAlice, Iris, Nina, Jeanne, Lou, Sarah, Oceane, Camille, Chloe, Pauline, Manon, Maxime, Margaux, Mathilde, and Lea.\nThey just spawn when you place a reforge anvil.\n\nVillagers at Hub:\n\nAndrew.\nObsessed with the skyblock forums.\n\nDuke.\nHe likes the Farm and the Coal Mine.\n\nFelix.\nNot to be confused with Felix aka PewDiePie, this guy just talks about the universal ender chest.\n\nLeo.\nTalks about the oak forest.\n\nLiam.\nSays that the admin houses will have a use, but no, staff is too busy adding plumber joe.\n\nLynn.\nMentions the quest log which is essentially a list of chores for you to do which is also a bar which takes up like 10% of your screen on the top.\n\nJack.\nHe explains your stats, but by the time you actually need to talk to him, your intelligence is 0 so I feel like this guys just a hidden roast.\n\nJamie.\nGives you a sword which used to be overpowered, and talks about mana.\n\nTom.\nExplains recipe book and gives you a recipe for an axe that literally no one uses.\n\nRyu.\nTalks about skills which is just a large grind.\n\nStella.\nYou learn about profiles and coops.\n\nVex.\nJust explains trading and gives you a dead bush since that's what his lower class can afford.\n\nMerchants at Hub:\n\nAdventurer.\nSells mob drops and and crappy talismans.\n\nAlchemist.\nSells potion stuff.\n\nArmorsmith.\nSells armor.\n\nBuilder.\nSells building mats.\n\nFarm Merchant.\nSells farming crops and stuff.\n\nFish Merchant.\nSells fish.\n\nLumber Merchant.\nSells wood and axes, also if you place water on the skulls in front of him, then the skulls turn into skeleton skulls which is disturbing since in front of the lumber merchant there's an axe that goes into one of the skulls.\n\nMine Merchant.\nSells ores, stone, picks, and a useless reforge stone.\n\nWeaponsmith.\nSells weapons, what do you think.\n\nOther NPCs in the Village:\n\nAuction Master.\nBasically runs this massive auctioning system where people put up things for auction or bins, auctions is where people outbid each other to buy it, bins for buy it now.\n\nGuy.\nHe just sells this upgrade which speeds up your personal bank item but for like 200k or something so it's not really worth it.\n\nDusk.\nTalks about runecrafting which not many people do, also it's not even available for unranked so like bruh.\n\nCarpenter.\nAgain, this guy talks about some cosmetic stuff that no one really uses.\n\nSalesman.\nJust gives some random stuff after you buy a rank (not p2w, stop complaining about it lol).\n\nMayor Seraphine.\nTalks about some community center or something that staff are going to add, yeah right.\n\nPlumber Joe.\nSells sponge which actually functions as sponge.\n\nBazaar.\nProbably one of the most important/vital npcs, it lets you insta buy/sell or create buy/sell orders for tons of different items, and it's a go-to method for earning money if you're smart.\n\nBea.\nSells bee pets which are honestly not the best pet.\n\nKat.\nExtremely useful npc who upgrades pets' rarities for coins and varying times.\n\nGeorge.\nHe's a scammer, he buys your pets for extremely low prices, he's only good if you're selling bad pets like rare endermen or something.\n\nZog.\nHe sells some pet items but the better ones are actually rare drops or can be crafted so you don't really need this guy in the long run.\n\nBlacksmith.\nLets you reforge your equipment which is basically adding some random pre-set stat boosts.\n\nMarco.\nIf you are ranked then you can speak to marco and access the canvas room which is a cosmetic room where you can spray paint pixel art.\n\nBartender.\nSells brews that are slightly better than awkward potions in some cases.\n\nMaddox the Slayer.\nGives slayer quests which are just mindless struggles of grinding the same bosses over and over again.\n\nTaylor.\nJust talks about tuxedos.\n\nSeymour.\nSells overpriced tuxedos.\n\nArthur.\nHe actually talks about compactors while ironically having a wheat minion which having compactors won't really help much since the seeds fill up the minion's slots really quickly.\n\nFarmer.\nWants wheat since he's a lazy kid who can't bother to leave the cow for 2 seconds and mine like 10 wheat.\n\nPat.\nSells gravel and flint as if anyone even needs them after unlocking critical pots.\n\nLumberjack.\nHis profession is to chop wood which is why he wants you to mine wood for him in a magical forest with regenerating trees, and he gives you a sweet axe which has a chance to give you apples but to be fair no one needs apples.\n\nFisherman.\nHe gives a prismarine rod once you fish 5 clay, but the prismarine rod SUCKS.\n\nBanker.\nJust keeps a bank account since he's totally not going to just run away with all the money right...\n\nTia the Fairy.\nI made a post on her specifically like 48 times but let me say it again in one sentence: so basically her mother and father did the logical thing and had over 200 children who all escaped and died in the stupidest places including the depths of the waters, the middle of a bush 40 blocks away from a spider infested island, behind a block under a pool of lava, and even in dungeons, and look at Tia, instead of actually caring, she just stands next to the pond and waits for players to just happen to collect all of her dead sisters and give her the souls, and lemme tell you something, the probability of having 210 female children is like 6*10^-64 that's extremely rare, and the fact that you get like +4 speed out of all of it is really thrilling.\n\nLucius.\nSells some talismans after you buy a ton from Sirius.\n\nShifty.\nSells brews, that's about it.\n\nSirius.\nOwns a probably illegal gathering every hour where he sells stuff like 5% better than normal books, a flower producing slave, a sword which is only good if you pay 50 mil for it, couple of pets who are being sold and processed, and tons of weird talismans.\n\nWizard.\nTalks about a wizard portal which STILL doesn't work (except there is an exception check out @Quaglet 's video here).\n\nLonely Philosopher.\nSells travel scroll to sven castle ruins place thing which literally takes 5 seconds to go to without the scroll.\n\nHub Selector.\nJust select hubs.\n\nFear Mongeror.\nSells halloween style stuff and hosts the event where server lag goes through the roof.\n\nGladiator.\nOwns the colosseum, just fight people in 1v1 with him.\n\nBaker.\nAt the end of each year he gives you a free cake (I bought year 69 for like 700k stop yelling at me).\n\nJerry.\nDuring the Winter Event, he just stands here and lets you teleport to the Jerry Workshop.\n\nBob and Bob.\nThey just yell at you to get back in line, bodyguards with no personalities.\n\nWool Weaver.\nSells wool.\n\nLibrarian.\nSells books and xp bottles.\n\nShania.\nIt's the cow who's sick but gets better after getting fed like 10 wheat.\n\nOringo the Pet Trafficker Traveller.\nHe sells pets like tiger, monkey, elephant, giraffe, blue whale, and lion, maybe more I don't remember.\n\nFarming Islands:\n\nFarmhand.\nGives you an enchanted bread and some farming xp if you gather some farming stuff.\n\nMining Islands:\n\nGold Forger.\nSells gold stuff and fancy swords.\n\nIron Forger.\nSells iron stuff and chainmail which is also pretty bad.\n\nRusty.\nGives you telekinesis on any weapon/tool for only 100 coins, easy.\n\nLazy Miner.\nJust a miner who stands at one place for like eternity and expects players to find (and not return) a smelting touch pickaxe.\n\nLift Operator.\nLets you go to different deep caverns floors, except you have to go there first.\n\nLapis Miner.\nGives you compactor in exchange for an iron pick (this happened like twice, I make a clean iron pick just for him and he takes the smelting touch one like why).\n\nWalter.\nSells superboom tnt for 2.5k per.\n\nCombat Islands:\n\nHaymitch.\nTalks about string and stuff, weird guy ngl.\n\nRick.\nGives a shovel that no one needs for 2 iron (even though iron shovels cost 1 iron).\n\nElle of the Nether.\nBrags that they beat the nether like 80 times even though they seem to have no armor and a base health of undefined, plus I've never personally seen her move anywhere so idk I'm a bit skeptical.\n\nGuber.\nGives stuff for completing a race multiple times including Technoblade's foot.\n\nPearl Dealer.\nSells end related stuff.\n\nGregory.\nSells bows and arrows that are overpriced as heck because of conveniency.\n\nForaging Islands:\n\nCharlie.\nWants wood, gives coins and storages.\n\nVanessa.\nGives rain for coins, pretty pointless imo.\n\nGustave.\nIf you do some really annoying races, you get free stuff.\n\nMelancholic Viking.\nYou gotta feed him fish, ruin his fireplace, and twerk sneak in front of him while he gets really happy, then he sells a raider axe which is not an axe and actually a sword but functions as an axe while breaking blocks, sells a scroll, some brewing stuff, and a book.\n\nRyan (and his cult).\nBasically gives/upgrades a badge while killing you with a powerful fire that can burn through any armor including doge armor.\n\nMelody.\nNO JUST NO, an npc which gives a strand of hair after getting 100% in a ton of songs which are near impossible to do.\n\nMaster Tactician Funk.\nSells wood singularity and tactician's sword.\n\nRomero and Juliette.\nKnockoff versions of that one play, they want tons of money for a weird ring to prove their love for each other, it's cringe.\n\nOld Shaman Nyko.\nSells true essence and true prot 1 books.\n\nDungeons:\n\nMalik.\nLets you do all kinds of reforging and essence crafting/salvaging/buying.\n\nMort.\nLets you do dungeons (I'm not explaining this in one sentence, okay?).\n\nOphelia.\nShopkeeper for random dungeons stuff.\n\nGuildford.\n3 different races each with like 10 different parts each with multiple runs available all for wither essence, this is true pain.\n\nHub Selector.\nSelect the hub, dungeon hub style.\n\nJerry's Workshop:\n\nGulliver.\nChicken race person, really annoying since checkpoint 4 is practically impossible.\n\nJerry.\nJerry.\n\nJerry.\nJerry.\n\nJerry.\nJerry.\n\nJerry.\nOkay I'll stop.\n\nFrosty.\nGives frosty the snow cannon.\n\nTerry.\nBasically reforges Salty and Treacherous, where the latter is the best one for all fishing rods.\n\nSaint Jerry.\nGives you one green gift if you find all 20 white ones.\n\nSherry.\nSells tons of random ice stuff.\n\nGary.\nRefills your snow cannons and can launch tons of snowballs if one gift pile is left.\n\nBanker Barry.\nJust normal banker, except Jerry.\n\nAgent Kapustin, Agent Kvasov, Agent Kruglov, and Agent Komarov.\nThey all say operation mayhem is coming soon but they've said that for MONTHS.\n\nRemoved:\n\nWarren.\nHe used to sell stock of stonks or something to do with it, but he gone now.\n\nPotato King.\n*inhale* So the potato king is an npc which originated from the potato war, which is an in-game war between two youtubers, the originally popular Technoblade vs the newly only-popular-because-of-this-war youtuber im a squid kid, and basically this war involved grinding potatoes, where squid kid had been #1 rank for a long time but Technoblade using his massive brain overtook that first place slot after using many techniques including massive potato farms, optimizing potato minions, sabotaging the enemies, using tons of alts, utilizing in-game features like pets, sacrificing tons of stuff like diamond spreading which is free money and instead of that, using a minion expander eventually replaced with the most expensive minion upgrade which is the flycatcher which speeds up minions with the excuse that they're not as distracted by flies even though there are literally no flies in minecraft, and on that note, they were originally fighting to get more than the other to obtain/keep the #1 spot, but after they agreed that the one to reach 500 million potatoes would be the winner, Technoblade won and as a reward, hypixel added this npc, which gives the following limited edition talismans: potato talisman (speeds up potato minions), potato basket of some kind (given to the top something people in potato collection), and an exclusive potato crown to Technoblade for winning, and this npc is now long gone (wow that was a long sentence).\n\nSimon.\nUsed to giveaway crab hats.\n\nSo now I have finished, this took me an hour and a half, please enjoy.\nIf you want to look at the interesting ones, look at Jerry, Potato King, Melody, Tia the Fairy, Sirius, the Viking, Romero and Juliette, Ryan and the cult, Elle of the Nether, Guber, Lumberjack, George, Zog, Bazaar, Auction Master, Banker, and Oringo

You could give me tips to tell the public(with this thread).\nAll you have to do with that is start a conversation with me and I'll put it in. (for the tips). You could also start a conversation with me\nto tell me some tips you want to share. Also, I will be contsantly updating this thread\n\n\u200bUpdate related\n\nWe all get hyped in updates right. Even I want to test things when they just release. However, I would not recommend using features that are just released.\n1, there is a chance for a bug to occur.There might be bugs that make you lose items, lose coins, lose your purse etc. I'd recommend not logging into skyblock for around 1 day and do something else. You could have a break from grinding and get out of the risk on losing coins!\n2, predict updates. This is somehow known but, can still earn you millions. My friend had earned 20 million coins from predicting speed talisman upgrades and investing in enchanted sugar canes. This surely is good for no effort right. I might make a guess for enchanted iron could be useful for dungeons.(this is just a random thing I thought of, just an example)\n3,grind right after updates. Even if this strategy gets very well known, people would want to check new things quickly. Use these few hours or days to grind zealots, tarantula slayers(cause it's hard to get a private one), and maybe spooky festivals. I found quite a few private lobbys (ex end lobbys, spider dens) after updates.\n\n\nSplash related\n1, do not pay for splashes usually. You know, there are a lot of 'god splash 100k entry, alchemy 50 pet luck' advertisements in chat. However, I doubt most of these are true. Some will be fake or scams. Some won't have alchemy 50 and some might not be a full god splash unlike the message. There are a lot of splash servers like Aspect of the Bumble discord (@Leocthl ty) and more.\n2, where to use splashes. If you are a midgame you might wonder where to use splashes. If you have items around ender armor and the AOTE(aspect of the end), you could farm enderman in the end. If you're lucky, you could get a pet and endermen are a good source of combat exp.(if you can kill them in 1 hit). The enderman pet can be good for now because it gives decent critical dmage. Also, since you are going to farm in the end for a while, the Enderian ability could be better than nothing. If you were just starting out, splashes aren't really important. You could use them for a bit extra damage. The damage could be used in the deep caverns or foraging trees(not damage but haste and speed).\n\n\nBuying items \n1, Bazaar You can buy infinite materials from bazaar if you have the coins. You need foraging 7, mining 7 and farming 7. I personnally am not a bazaar flipper so, I would like tips from professional bazaar flippers to add in this thread. So, never insta buy things unless it is cheap overall. Instantly buying items makes you pay a certain, high price. You can buy things for a lower price if you are patient and wait a bit more. With the same logic, you could sell for more using 'make a sell order'\n2, The Auction house The Auction house is really a gamble. But, before I get in, there are two options: BIN(buy it now) and the classic auction. The bin is something where you can buy things for a certain price. The auction is where you bid more coins to outbid the other and win the item. A Bin can be a safe option to buy things quickly. An auction could make you frustrated if someone is keep outbidding you. You can make profit if the other person isn't bidding more at a low price. You could also set a price that is not overpaying but will make the next bid overpay. I'd recommend to set a reasonable price and hope for the other guy to not outbid you. If they do, just give it up.\n\n\nSlayers\n1, finding private lobbys 1 - 1: Revenants. if you have vip or higher, use the small lobby option from the lobby selecter. If you don't have a rank, it's fine. Just look for a lobby that is not crowded. Even if they are, if noone is bothering you, that's good. 1 - 2: tarantulas. No tip really unless you have enough patience to go through spider's den lobbys. 1 - 3: sven packmasters. If you are strong enough to fight in the howling cave, do it! If you can't use the same method as revenants and do the boss in water.\n\nMinions\n1.*this is when you just started and need slots quickly. Go mining and get as many possible mining(from the deep caverns) minions. You could also put some farming minions(like wheat as they are quick). **DON'T place 2 or more minions of the same kind. After this, go foraging and make those minions. Craft all tier 1s and after working a bit, go back to your island to collect minion generated stuff. This would make you get a few more minions. Credit to @the_sky_rider for telling me these tips\n2. Minion items. I suggest you use a compactor and a supercompactor. Fuels are essential but, enchanted chacarol is good if you don't have an enchanted lava bucket. DO NOT use hoppers unless you have money to spare. \n\n\n\n\nThank you for listening and this thread is still in W.I.P. To give me other tips to add here, just start a conversation with me. I will credit you.

He was eager for that birthday for her to come and give her the gift he had bought. But , things were already fallen apart. He came home, But it wasnt a happiness. It was the true horror , sadness, One that Cannot be compared to someones heart shattering in pieces. Little scraf was scared, Tears rolled down.\n\nHis family ... was killed.\nAll he would see a shadow , with a darkness he never seen. Shadow said \" Your families souls are mine\". The boy was Sad , but his angry was far more for him to handle. He rushed at the shadow with sharpest object he had with him. But , he lost. Shadow said \" is that all u have? You are weak. But ill have u under me as my commanders. But ill sure let u have those emotions you have. The world shall know the NECRON\".

But he still remembered that his mom always looked happy when he said those words , Ill make u one day proud with my studies.\n\nFrom then he studied everything possible in the world. He was known \" Scarf , The Summoner\". Scarf, was always studying hard , so that one day he can revive his mom back.

I'm upset mainly because they introduced a new bonzo's staff that looks like a flower and worth ten fold. This is power creep and such is a bad mechanic. 4 floors later they might add something that looks like Jerry and deals 2x the damage of bonemerang while 10x its price.\nAnd READ THE 4th POINT. YOU BERSERKERS AND HEALERS WANT MORE THINGS RIGHT? \nI took so many times explaining the reasons behind and it's better to chill and read it than just typing \"oof another stupid mage\". Come on the length is just like patch notes right guys?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI have to make this I guess?\nShort points:\n1. mana changes does nothing for mages but hurts others\n2. damage changes along with new mage items feels like power creep\n3. the change is too sudden. Hypixel gave too much for mages at the beginning that now it feels bad.\n4. archer items(bonemerang) feels like too early to have, especially alongside spirit bow. Others classes, e.g. healers, gets nothing.\n5. Thorn fight feels a bit plain. (Personal feelings)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome more explanation here:\nThe problem of archer receiving more things this patch isn't a big problem by itself, but the trend is worrying.\nFirst they make mages op in the first 3 floors, then archers in F4, overshadowing everyone else. If this trend continues we might see berserks be op next, and tanks, and mages again for example, and you see where this is going.\nThere will be a super op class each floor and upsets the others. That's why I say classes should received more balanced things each time. You see, what did healers get for each of the floors?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo now Floor 4 is released for some time, and people are upset about it, especially mages. As a mage player, I saw a nerf coming as well as some others, but we don't expect it to hit that hard. This post is to talk about why this update is upsetting and actually worrying. I mainly focuses on mage changes, and thoughts on F4 loots and the boss fight.\n\nMana changes\nSo mana regeneration is reduced while for every physical hits you gain mana. The purpose of this change is to \"make abilities usage more strategic\" but I believe that this change has failed to deliver that. As a mage instead of clicking right click, you now click both and you have the same effect (Wow so difficult). Mage's difficulty is never on mana management but on switching item, especially between damage items(Bonzo's Staff, Frozen Scythe etc.) and AOTE. Try to solo a Shadow Assassin and you'll get what I mean.\nThis change actually hurts other classes more, e.g. Healer, as mana management IS their difficulty now, and when they introduce more healing items, healer will become significantly harder to play.\nSo I guess they missed the target on this change.\n\nMagic damage nerfs\nIn short, what they did are:\n1. delete Pigman's Sword\n2. nerf the damage of Bonzo's Staff and Frozen Scythe by a f*** ton\n3. introduce a weapon similar to Bonzo's Staff now (Dreadlord Sword)\n4. introduce a weapon similar to Bonzo's Staff BEFORE THE NERF (Spirit Sceptre) but it's 10x more expensive\n\nI'll take about the feelings of the nerf later, we focus on game mechanics here. And this is very unhealthy in some ways. Direct power creep.\n\nA short term effect is that the prices of Pigman Sword and Bonzo's Staff will crash, and it's happening now. To new players grinding Floor 1 is no longer profitable. This is unhealthy to the economy. Imagine a nerf to Bonemerang just before Floor 5 and you invested millions on it. What would you feel archers?\n\nBut the serious one is the long term effect. What they essentially done to mages is \"remove their weapon and give the the same thing back with 10x the price\". I think you see why this is unhealthy. This can be done to any class in the future, but mage is still the most worrying, as they seem to have no other ideas but circular AoEs. We have three of them now (Bonzo, Dreadlord, Spirit Secptre), and four if you count the mage sheep as one.\n\nContrast (Before and After)\nThis is the feeling part. The two nerfs combined essentially reduces mage's damage by more than half. I was able to 2-shot a F3 Skeletor, now I 5-shot it.\nTHIS. FEELS. BAD.\nYes, mage was pretty op before the nerf, but it just feels bad simply because of such contrast, but not because it's actually weak. And one thing that they did it wrongly, as everyone else suggests, is that they nerfed the wrong stats.\nLet's take a League of Legends example here. If I wanna play mage I'll go with either Syndra, Xerath, or Lissandra, not a Mordekaiser. Whether it's a burst mage, a long-ranged poke or a medium-ranged crowd control AoE, they should be squishy and deals damage, unlike a bruiser. The mage this patch feels like an AP berserker more than anything else.\n\nOne more thing: RIP pigman sword. It's op before because it shreds bosses, and they deleted the item instead of fixing it. Now I really miss its AoE potential inside a bunch of cows.\n\nContrast (with other classes)\nThis floor 4 update brings unbalanced number of items to each class. Healer received the least out of everything(new helmet), then Mage(basically old Bonzo), then Berserk(best sword as of now) and Tank(sew set and sword), and the rest of the items goes to Archers. Archers receives:\n1. A new bow which is better than mosquito\n2. Another new bow which has better stats than Gilded 50m Midas and deals 3x damage\n3. A new ultimate enchant(Rend, which is basically Kalista's E from LoL and can be quite broken against bosses)\n4. A new set (seems mediocre but still a set)\n\nBasically, Archers receive half of the new items of this patch. The great imbalance brings huge disappointment to other classes, especially mages(who got hit VERY hard and receives basically nothing but financial burden to get back to where they were) and healers(basically didn't received any specific things in any of the floors).\nIf the trend continues, we will have for every floor 1 class that is happy and 4 that is disappointed. Clearly unhealthy.\n\nAnd now possibly archers won't receive anything from floor 5 or even 6. Be prepared.\n\nAnd yes I know archers were weak before. I tried it. But after the fixes 2 weeks ago I already see archers doing huge numbers. This is just too much in a single patch.\n\nFloor 4 Boss Fight\nA bit of a personal opinion, but it feels like the Floor 4 Boss fight most boring out of all 4 bosses. Floor 1 is a simple 2-phase fight for beginners, Floor 2 is 2-phase fight in which the ordering of what you kill matters, Floor 3 is a 3-phase which requires teamwork(best out of all 4 in my opinion), and Floor 4 now is a 1-phase chaotic animal fiesta. Not that I hate it, but I see some problems:\n1. The fight challenges your computer's GPU more than anything else,\n2. You die randomly to bats,\n3. The floor is a bit too difficult to casuals who reached around Lv15,\n4. Takes waaaaay too long for the bear to spawn, which makes the fight a bit too long, and missing the arrow is very punishing. \nLong fights are not necessarily a bad thing, it it's floor 4 and we have 6 more to go for normal mode. How long can the last fight be?\n\nNote: if the decoy strat is intended then this fight is genius. Not only is it way more comfortable it is also a good use of a trash item people previously thought. Decoy might need to have a duration though.\n\nAgain, personal opinion. What you think is up to you.\n\nSuggestions\nSome suggestions to make mages feel better, as well as for the implementation of next floors.\n\n1. Partially revert the decrease in damage for mages, possibly along with an increase in mana cost and a decreases in defense.\nA possible solution: mages' defense scales off with mana. You will have to think if you want to clear the room, or stay at high mana so you won't get one-shotted.\n\n2. Introduce a variety of mage weapons, instead of a better version of old weapons.\nBonzo and Frozen Scythe is an example, and one of them is circular AoE while the other is a piercing projectile, as well as things like Voodoo doll. BUT NOT SPIRIT SECPTRE.\nIce spray wand(from looking at ice essence) seems a good step to this direction and it may be usable by healers as a support item too.\n\n3. Don't nerf things too hard at once. It feels bad.\n\n4. Give similar amounts of items to each class for each floor.\nFor example Bonemerang should be made a floor 5 or even floor 6 drop. Archers received the spirit bow and rend this patch and it's already pretty good.\n\n5.

He had was sent in the forest to hide , till the wither essence was destroyed and disease was cured. Unfortunately the village couldn't survive the disease and lost. While , running in the forest he encountered a Demon. At that moment he was about to get killed , a Yeti dashed in and Defeated the monster. He barely saw him and fainted. When he regained consciousness he was in a cave where the yeti was sitting next to him. He quickly retreated back with fear , but was finally convinced that it was the yeti who saved him. The conversation went by and the yeti understood the situation. Yeti was a protector of the forest , who understood human language and helped those who were in trouble and sadness. They were best friends now. But one day...\n\nA stormy day, Full of fear and sadness. The forest was Corrupted with wither essence, undead forces approached near them. The yeti fought them alone, to protect the boy, to protect the forest. But he couldnt fight for long. He was soaked in blood and fell on the ground. The boy , Cried his name loud and loud, When HE came. The Shadow said : You are perfect. You will assist me from now on. The boy was scared, he screamed yetis name and heard some faint voice from yeti. He couldnt hear it. Soon he was hit and the boy was unconscious. When he came back.. he saw himself turned demon.\n\nHes gone. Hes not coming back..How can i bring him back\nThe shadow said : Serve me and i promise you to bring him back\nWho are you ?\nThe shadow : hahahhah... The World shall Know The Necron!! ( He disappears)\n\nThe boy grew up, Learned skills. He was able to summon withered Animals, which were his memory of his friends. He renamed himself The Thorn because in his life, the most precious things gave him pain. His memory was hurting him, making him sad. His life was just like a thorn hurting people , hurting souls. Thorn protected the floor 4 by killing the people who wanted to kill the demons. He did bad things to them.\n\nThorn while dying to heroes : What was this life? It was a pain to soul. Thorny heart , Thorny memories.\nthen he suddenly remembered Yeti's Words..\nThorn: What were they... Dont commit a Sin.\nThorn : Ugh... I see, why i couldn't revive him. Im sorry Friends. Forgive me yeti.. Forgive me\nThorn Saying to the Tank\nThorn: Child , Dont suffer.. Be happy.. you have a better life. Live happily\nThorn sees The eye of Necron and destroys it.\nThorn dies.\n\n\nA short Info if u didnt get the story: Thorn at the end realized that living for others can pick out thorns from ones memory. He realized that, all this time he committed a sin destroying lives and hearts of people just because of his selfishness. He was deeply shocked after remembering yetis last words later on. Thorn wanted the heroes to live happily and not end up with his actions and life. Then he remembered that , Necron was the pure evil and destroyed his family and his friend. In the rules of Necrology u cannot attack the ally commanders or items of Catacombs. So the last moment said that, he was enemy of Necron and wanted to kill him by protecting the heroes."}, {"title": "Can someone rank the dungoen bows lole", "body": "Lol can someone rank the dungoen BOWs (that means no bonemeringue)\neg:\n1.

When dungeons finally came out, perfect armour was only useful for a few days before people just started using armour such as 5 star adaptive. 5 star perfect looks decent, but is currently unusable due to the catacombs 30 requirement.

I'm making this post so people can be aware of the bugs, some are just small bugs but some could cause you to possibly lose items.\n3.

I'm sure there are more bugs, I'm just listing the ones I know.\n6. Some of these bugs happen on more than just floor 4, If so the bug will be green otherwise it will be blue.\n\nList of bugs:\n1. Bats during the Thorn boss fight are unable to kill Decoys\n2. Mobs can spawn after Thorn is defeated and they attack you(note: if you die to these mobs kill a fairy in the audience otherwise you may not get chest prizes)\n3. You can AOTE through iron bars\n4.

Hitting Thorn with a bone boomerang stops him then causes him to move hyper-speed https://hypixel.net/threads/the-floor-4-dungeon-boss-was-speed-hacking.3197346/\n6. Sometimes flight will be disabled as a ghost\n7. When using spirit boots, your hand item is visually replaced as either nothing or the spirit boots themselves, and your armor slots get all messed up(note: as far as I know this is just visual and when you update that slot it all changes back to normal, just, be careful)\n8. Tiger pets can double strike Thorn\n9. Spirit bow shots sometimes bounce off of Thorn\n10. The question puzzle sometimes shows the text of the last question after you beat it(This is just visual)\n11. During the Thorn boss you can hit teammates to regen mana\n12.

It's still a clicking simulator.\nIt just turned from a right-clicking simulator to a block-hitting simulator.\nPersonally, I feel this is bad. Should just everything in Skyblock be a clicking simulator?\nTo fix the problem, we should look at the reasons first.\nPart II: The reasons\nMage class is mainly focused on ability damage. This limits on what Mage class can do, since it mainly uses abilities (AOTD, Pigman, Frozen Scythe, Bonzo's Staff) and cannot deal normal melee damage like berserkers, archers and tanks.\nHypixel changed the mana regeneration system by nerfing passive mana regeneration in Dungeons and allowing mana-steal from mobs. This is quite flawed as block-hitting has the same effect, if not stronger, to the previous mana regeneration and didn't make Mage more of a technical class like it was supposed to be. Hypixel also nerfed ability damage of the mainstream mage weapons (Bonzo's Staff, Frozen Scythe and Pigman Sword), but that only made people who were using mage class simply click more.\nThen comes Floor 4, with a lot of mobs. This is clearly the time for the Mage class to shine, as Mage is the only class that deals AOE damage (aside from Tank's first ability which shoves a straight line dealing AOE damage). However, there are actually little AOE weapons for Mage class that actually work, as Bonzo's Staff and Pigman Sword, the mainstream AOE weapons literally deal no damage. There are probably only two choices now for AOE damage: Yeti Sword, which is incredibly expensive, and Dreadlord Sword, which is cheap and efficient. There's also Spirit Scepter, but it's also very expensive.\nTo sum up this chunk of text, I'd say the main problems of Mage are\n1. If you don't block hit, you will lose lots of mana in a short period of time unless you use cheap mana weapons.\n2. The AOE weapons like Bonzo's Staff and Pigman Sword got nerfed to the ground, which only leaves room for Dreadlord Sword and other very expensive items.\n3. Since AOE items are so expensive, Dreadlord Sword becomes the only plausible choice, but it doesn't do that much damage against mobs.\nPart III: The solution\nWith the reasons above, it's time to talk about solutions.\nThere are two main approaches I think Hypixel could use to solve the problem.\n\n\nSpoiler: 1st Approach\n\n\n\nThe first approach: Let other damage classes do AOE damage.\nLetting archers and berserkers deal AOE damage would benefit in the fight of F4 a lot more. Right now it's very chaotic as the animals keep on spawning and there's no real way to kill them before another animal spawns to take its place. Berserker has needed new weapons for a long time now, so why not use this as an opportunity to buff these two classes by introducing new AOE weapons that work with them?\n\nExample [for berserker]:\nEarth's Power\n+ 175 Damage\n+ 125 Strength\nItem Ability: Ground Smash: Deal 50% of your damage to all enemies in a 10-block radius. For each enemy hit, increase the next use of this ability's damage by 2% (Max: 14%)\nMana Cost: 75\nEPIC DUNGEON SWORD\nI imagine the sword above would be dropped by Thorn. This would make Berserkers have more of a role in beating Thorn.\n\nAnother one, this time for Archers:\nExplosive Charge\nItem Ability: Explosive Charge: Consumed when fired by a bow. Deal 75% of your damage to all enemies in a 5-block radius on where the arrow lands.\nRARE ARROW CHARGE\nThis would probably be bought from Ophelia. This would make Archer be somewhat an AOE-clearing class.\n\nBad things about this solution: If done wrong, one of the classes would become like pre-nerf mage: Too overpowered.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: 2nd Approach\n\n\n\nThe second approach: Increasing variety of Mage AOE weapons.\nRight now, Mage doesn't have a lot of AOE weapons that are cheap. This made me think for a while on what could be implemented, and suddenly I thought of the Professor (2nd phase) and Scarf's Undead Mage attacks.\nOf course, you could just buff back Pigman to a fraction of what it once was, and buff Bonzo's Staff and Frozen Scythe's scalings to increase their damage output. However, this would not solve the problem of lacking AOE weapons.\nOne of them is to buff weapons that are forgotten, like the Golem Sword and Ember Rod. Here's some ideas:\nRod of Flames\n+ 125 Damage\n+ 65 Strength\nIntelligence: +50\nItem Ability: Fire Blast: Shoot 3 Fireballs which explode upon impact, dealing 500 base Magic Damage to all enemies in a 5-block radius and burning them for 50 base Magic Damage for 5s.\nMobs that are burned have their defense reduced by 5%.\nMana Cost: 100, Cooldown: 10s\nEPIC SWORD\n\nThis would probably be upgraded with some Ember Essence (4 stacks?) but would deal AOE damage and burn the mobs.\n\nFlaming Rod of Fire\n+ 165 Damage\n+ 85 Strength\nIntelligence: +150\nItem Ability: Fire Blast: Shoot 3 Fireballs which explode upon impact, dealing 1000 base Magic Damage to all enemies in a 5-block radius and burning them for 500 base Magic Damage for 5s.\nMobs that are burned have their defense reduced by 5%.\nMana Cost: 90, Cooldown: 8s\nLEGENDARY SWORD\n\nThis would be upgraded from the Rod of Flames and cost 8 stacks of Ember Essence.\n\nEndstone Golem Sword\n+ 165 Damage\n+ 65 Strength\nDefense: +100\nItem Ability: Endstone Punch: Punch the ground, damaging enemies in a hexagon 7 blocks around you for 750 base Magic Damage.\nMana Cost: 75, Cooldown: 3s\nEPIC SWORD\n\nThis one would be upgraded by something dropped by the Endstone Protector (likely Endstone Essence or something like that) and cost at least 2 stacks of it and some Enchanted Iron Blocks to upgrade it.\n\nNow, to the next part, other weapons.\n\nSo when thinking about this post, I remembered that The Professor has a Tsunami attack which is somewhat like Yeti Sword, and the Undead Mage has a Soul Sand Blizzard attack which he fires a straight line of soul sand at the player. This could be used for Mage class AOE weapon ideas. Here's my idea on that:\n\nOceanic Blade\n+ 100 Damage\n+ 50 Strength\nItem Ability: Tsunami: Create a wave of water (6 blocks wide) that travels in a straight line up to 24 blocks. Deal 1,500 Magic Damage to any enemy caught in the path of the water.\nMana Cost: 250, Cooldown: 6s\nLEGENDARY DUNGEON SWORD\nThis would definitely be dropped by the Professor. This would fit the theme of his 'ocean' boss fight.\n\nUndead Mage's Wand\n+ 75 Damage\n+ 25 Strength\nItem Ability: Soul Sand Blizzard: Create a wave of Soul Sand (3 blocks wide) that travels in a straight line up to 16 blocks, dealing 1000 Magic Damage to any enemy caught in the path of the soul sand.\nMana Cost: 125, Cooldown: 5s\nRARE DUNGEON SWORD\nThis would be dropped on Floor 2.\n\nBad things about this solution: It introduces too many Mage weapons while not caring about the other classes.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, these two approaches will let people deal AOE damage, and could buff weak classes.\n\nPart IV: Conclusion\nRight now, AOE weapons are mainly used by mage class, and they are either very expensive and good, or not as good and cheap. Hypixel should consider making new weapons for the other classes to deal AOE damage, or introduce new weapons for Mage class to deal AOE damage. If done correctly, this will create a chance for all damage classes to deal AOE damage, which would allow for more class diversity in my mind.\n\nThanks for reading!

The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis.\n\nWheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014).[5] World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.[6] In 2017, world production of wheat was 772 million tonnes, with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes,[7] making it the second most-produced cereal after maize.[7][8] Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century.[9] Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.[10][11]\n\nWheat is an important source of carbohydrates.[10] Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals[12] but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids.[13][14] When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber.[10]\n\nIn a small part of the general population, gluten \u2013 the major part of wheat protein \u2013 can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis.[15]\n\nsuperior dragon armor"}, {"title": "Mage nerf poll", "body": "Can we all just agree that moving one class from the best to not usable is a dumb idea and is going to lose so may people so much money."}, {"title": "[Suggestion] Add more mage armour to dungeons.", "body": "Currently there are only 2* mage armours sets: Wise Dragon armour and Adaptive armour*\nNow this is a problem, because the first one isn't even a dungeon and its dungeonised version requires level 28 and costs a lot of dragon essence to do so, while the other option, require a completion of the third floor, which require quite a high level and good gear.

While wielded items may use Mana, none of the Dungeon Orb spells makes use of it. This is where this suggestion steps in.\n\nFixed Mana Cap: To circumvent Mana Cap Changes due to weapons, players must choose a Main Weapon that cannot move from their Hotbar to keep a stable Mana Cap.\n\n- Overview -\n\nAs stated before, Advanced Play plans to make use of Mana with the Dungeon Orb. The idea is that players will have the option to play in Normal Play (Current Dungeons) or Advanced Play (This Mode). This brings some changes to each class's spells that they are able to cast.\n\nSomething I want to emphasise: These two categories should ABSOLUTELY NOT be mingled. These are essentially two different class sets.\n\n- Class Changes -\n\nMage: Guided Sheep uses [200 Mana - (<Mage Level> * 2)] to cast. Cooldown reduced to 80%. Ultimate uses [100% Mana - (<Mage Level> * 5)]. Cooldown is increased to 600s, but the effect time is raised to 20s.\nExample: At Mage Lv 0 with 375 Mana Cap, you need 375 Mana to cast your Ultimate.\n\nHealer: Healing Circle uses 100 Mana to cast. Cooldown reduced to 75%. Ultimate uses 75% Mana. Cooldown remains unchanged.\nExample: With 100 Mana Cap, you need 75 Mana to cast your Ultimate.\n\nBerserk: Throwing Axe uses 50 Mana to cast. Cooldown raised to 125%. Ultimate uses 80% Mana. Cooldown is reduced to 50s.\nExample: With 100 Mana Cap, you need 80 Mana to cast your Ultimate.\n\nArcher: Explosive Shot uses 60 Mana to cast. Cooldown remains unchanged. Ultimate uses 80% Mana. Cooldown remains unchanged.\nExample: With 100 Mana Cap, you need 80 Mana to cast your Ultimate.\n\nTank: Seismic Wave uses 125 Mana to cast. Cooldown reduced to 75%. Ultimate uses 50% Mana. Cooldown remains unchanged, but all damage done is cut in half for 10s. Players within 10 blocks receive 10% of your current defence.\nExample: With 100 Mana Cap, you need 50 Mana to cast your ultimate.\n\n- Pros and Cons -\n\n\n\nProsConsMana Potions become more usefulRequires own category due to deviance from current classesMana Usage increasesMore Behind-The-Scene calculationsClass ReworksClass Reworks????\n\nThink I missed something?

A lot of business psychology can apply to business anywhere even in a video game. I\u2019ll explain it easily. \n\n1. Appearance is everything. \n\nIf you walk into a supermarket and everything looks like crap, you will probably turn around and walk out. Most other island shops aren\u2019t successful because they don\u2019t look nice. It doesn\u2019t have to be a professional build, but at least put in more effort than a few signs and maybe an item frame. Have some nice architecture, maybe follow a theme like castle or modern, cubist or something. If it looks nice people want to come back. \n\n2. Be organized. \n\nGroup similar items together. This makes it easy for people to find things. This ties in very closely with the appearance of the shop. To use my island as an example (/visit Xeon11) I have many displays that each have similar objects. In one area I have crops, but I don\u2019t just have signs that say \u201cpotato\u201d and stuff. Built into the floor is a dirt block with water next to it and a potato planted on it. Above the potato on the wall is an item frame with an enchanted potato in it. This looks really nice, but it also shows people I sell enchanted versions too. There is an armory section of my shop that is separated into weapons and armor. The armor section has one of each frag displayed in item frames on the wall. Armor stands hold the full armor sets I have while other item frames on the wall hold the individual pieces I don\u2019t have full sets of. In the weapons section the best weapons are front and centered on the wall while the rest are in weapon racks. Make everything look nice and make it easy to find what the customer wants. \n\n3. Pricing\n\nThis is the most important one probably. So many island shops I see have super high prices. I could just go buy the materials to make the same thing on bazaar for half the price. This along with the fact that prices fluctuate, is the reason the best island shop must USE BAZAAR FOR EVERYTHING. If you base your prices off bazaar you will not only be fair but will also make more money. The website https://skyblock-tool.xyz/ shows all the stuff the bazaar sells and at what price, and is updated constantly. This next part might be confusing but it is the most important part of pricing. This is how you get people to buy from you and also make more money than you could by selling straight to bazaar. \n\nBazaar sells items to you, but he will also buy items from you. Let\u2019s just say for example you can buy an enchanted diamond from him for 2200, and if you were to sell him one he would pay you 1800. If your price at your shop is above 2200, no one will buy from you because they could get the same thing for cheaper at bazaar. If you sell lower than 1800, you are losing money because you could get 1800 just by selling to bazaar. However, if you set your price at 2000, in between the bazaar\u2019s buy and sell prices, you make more money than if you were to sell to him and people will buy from you because they save money by doing so. This is the absolute best way to price your items. \n\nFor reference here\u2019s how I price things bazaar doesn\u2019t sell.\n\nMinions- the price for the mats to craft whatever tier it is, if it\u2019s above 5 I only count enchanted mats. \n\nCrystal Frags- go to bazaar and use the price of a catalyst. It\u2019s basically the same cuz a catalyst just uses a crystal frag and 8 end stone. \n\nDragon Armor- the cost of the frags to make it, plus the cost of any hot potato books and the cost of the materials used to craft the enchants on it. Normally I only count enchants that are valuable like growth and stuff. \n\nSlayer Items- is bazaar sells mats use those, but otherwise use ah. \n\nFor anything else use auction house. Don\u2019t use the first price you see because it\u2019s normally the highest. Look through and make a rough average of what the price is. \n\n4. Customer Service\n\nYou have to be nice with people. For me personally I\u2019m in college and I get a little pissed when little kids come to my shop and beg for free stuff or million dollar discounts. But still I\u2019m nice I tell them I can\u2019t and I see what I can help them with. If they keep bothering me I\u2019ll be a bit more blunt with them and if I need to I\u2019ll ask them to leave or kick them. Relationships are very helpful to have as well because you never know when you\u2019ll need a favor.\n\n5. You need suppliers\n\nThere are so many items in this game and it\u2019s impossible to get them all yourself. You need to have people that can supply you with the stuff you don\u2019t have. I have around 30 suppliers for my shop. Basically our agreement is they donate me free stuff that they can spare and I give them discounts off of items in my shop. The size of the discount depends on the value of what they donate. I have people donate hot potato books, dragon armor, enchanted items, rare event items, and even super valuable stuff such as an aotd and one time even some superior dragon boots. These suppliers are what allows me to carry as much as I can in my shop.\n\nAlso on a side note it\u2019s best to sell as much as you can in your shop not just a few things, and if you specialize in something like potions or gear make sure to have quality and quantity items. \n\n6. Services\n\nThese make me more money than anything else. A service is something someone pays you to do for them. Some common ones are pearl spamming and god splashes. I try to have unique services at my shop. Right now these are some services I offer at my shop:\n\nEnchanting Weapons and Armor- you need to have a lot of the enchant recipes unlocked. You also need to have grand experience bottle handy.\n\nOrders- people can order items from me in bulk and I will go get them and let them know when it\u2019s ready. \n\nKat Pet Slot Rental- people can use my Kat pet upgrade slot. I\u2019m at taming 20 so I can do epic to legendary upgrades. Normally I charge 50k up front and then a certain amount per day for how long it takes. They supply the money and mats to upgrade the pet. \n\nCrafting and Brewing- I spend time maxing out collections to get all the recipes, for a small price I can craft things for people if they supply the mats. \n\nPet Leveling- I will level up their pet to a certain level, max 50, for a base fee of 50k and then a certain amount every level depending on what rarity the pet is. \n\n\nThese are more useful and popular than most items I sell in my shop. \n\n7. Entertainment\n\nI\u2019m MVP+, so I can have a maximum of 5 people on my island (btw you should have mvp+ for your shop for this reason, other ranks work but aren\u2019t as good. MVP++ is best). There will obviously be some times when I can\u2019t help everyone at once. You need to have things for people to do while they wait. I have secret rooms on my island, and my island is super big so people can explore. I have several parkour courses people can try and one of them is hardcore parkour, you need young dragon armor and over 300 speed in some places. I have people come for the parkour alone sometimes. If people have fun on your island and in your shop they will comeback again. \n\n8. Advertising and being recognized\n\nYou can\u2019t make money if no one knows you exist. Normally I will advertise my shop in the hub. If you join a hub server with 70+ people your message will most likely get lose in all the other ones. I like to join hubs with 50-65 people in them. The way you word your advertisement is important too. If you just say \u201cVISIT MY ISLAND SHOP\u201d you won\u2019t get as many people. Normally I just talk to people then bring up I own a shop, or I\u2019ll bring up key parts of my shop. You need to know what people like about your shop so you know what to put in your ad. I sell things lower than bazaar ALWAYS, and that\u2019s popular so I say that. Normally I can get 5 people from a single hub if I\u2019m lucky, sometimes I need 2 hubs tho. Also make sure to return to your island somewhat quickly after you see someone join, you don\u2019t want to leave them waiting. \n\n9. Don\u2019t trust people\n\nAs a business owner you need to be honest with your customers, but that doesn\u2019t mean you leave them alone with an open cash register. Don\u2019t trust anyone except your friends. Only trust people when there is a reason for them to not double cross you. Half of the time people get scammed it\u2019s their own fault. They trusted a stranger. Some guy just gav me his mastiff when I asked for help with slayers. I gav it back because I want an honest reputation for my shop, but I could hav easily /ignored him and stolen his mastiff. \n\nPeople will try to rip you off. They might tell you your selling way to high. That\u2019s another reason why using bazaar is good. U can go tell them to check bazaar. YOU MUST KNOW YOUR PRICES. If you don\u2019t it\u2019s easy for people to manipulate you. \n\n10. Be smart with your money\n\nI make 1-2 million a day on average, sometimes it\u2019s up to 5 million other days it\u2019s 250k. Island shops are potentially one of the best ways to make money in the game. You need to be wise with the money you make. Invest some of it back into your shop by buying materials to make it look nicer, or if bazaar is selling an item for super cheap buy some of it then wait a few days and resell it at your shop. People think bazaar flipping makes money, you should see how much more u can make by flipping items from the bazaar to other players. \n\nWell it\u2019s 4:30 am now and those are all the things I can think of about how I run my shop. I just try to be honest, make it look nice, and be unique from other shops. I\u2019m not even an endgame player and I\u2019m making more money than some of them. Once I\u2019m in endgame and I can sell super rare stuff regularly I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be a rich boi. \n\nI hope this helps anyone out there get started on their island shops. If you make one I\u2019d love to see stop by my island or party me, I can\u2019t take friend reqs from random people because I get so many each day from customers, if I accepted all my list would max out. Another way I advertise my shop is in the skyblock discord server, or at least one of them. Let me know what you think or any ideas, I\u2019ll update this in the future if I need to and make edits."}, {"title": "scammers are kinda stupid", "body": "some dude when i was a noob (and still am dont look at my skylea) scammed me out of a night vision charm.\n\nwhy would u risk everything for like 30k?

As of right now, it is in a weird position.\n\nHealer does not do much damage, and the class promotes not doing damage. It was possible to deal damage with something like a Frozen Scythe, but now that magic damage is dead for all classes except mage (as it should be), Healer is like a weaker tank that can revive allies, and is even more boring.\n\nI've seen many threads proposing a damage buff to healer or proposing weapons that deal damage via leeching hp and healing allies. The first one is a strange idea, and I'm not sure I completely agree. The second one is a good idea, but I feel we're approaching the class in the wrong way.\n\nHealer is not a damage class.\n\n\nSpoiler: Healer is not a damage class\n\n\n\nHealer is a class that you play because you want something out of it. Be it free entry into almost any party, internet stans, or because you actually want to heal allies, we all play Healer for a reason. If that reason is because you want to deal damage and not take a lot of damage, then you're playing the class wrong and should be playing Berserker.\n\n\n\nHealer is lacking in content.\n\n\nSpoiler: Healer is lacking in content.\n\n\n\nAs of right now, there is not very many youtubers who play healer. The only ones I can think of are FurryEBoy (who doesn't film content) and ZachPlaysAN. This isn't simply because Mage is so insanely powerful it overrides every other class (although it was), it's because Healer is boring and not interesting to make videos on. It doesn't have items, it doesn't have strategies, it has nothing except the debate of whether or whether not the Reaper Mask works (it does).\n\nThroughout history, healer classes have been boring to play. Be it Mercy, the Medic, Healer, or Soraka, we all stand to the side spam clicking healing abilities or even just existing, wishing that we could get in there and stab things and die like all the other classes.\n\n\n\nHealer gains nothing from levels, and it's hard to gain levels.\n\n\nSpoiler: Healer gains nothing from levels\n\n\n\nHealer is a healer. It's obvious. It's plain. It's lacking in items, and it's lacking in a reason to grind. It has three items that you need. That's it. There's no progression, and the only progression that might be considered true class progression is getting to sven 7 for an overflux. You get no good benefits from leveling up. When you reach healer 25, your healing circle is a full two blocks larger. Two. Blocks. That's ONE HIT from any mob, and then the player is out of the circle screaming at you for being an incompetent disappointment. When you reach Healer 33, you acquire the 5 star reaper mask, which was the strongest item on the AHN. It's good, and it's actual progression.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: It's hard to gain levels.\n\n\n\nThis seems like progression, right? Well, yes and no. It's a good thing to strive for, and things like this give you a reason to grind (even though it's the only grind-worthy item for healer). However, healer gets about 15% LESS experience then all the other classes. The reason?\nMilestones.\nMilestones are a good decision by the admins that I appreciate. The issue with them, however, is that Healer's milestones don't benefit from speedruns. If you're doing runs in sub 10 minutes, you won't get milestone 4. You'll barely get milestone 3. My friend (who's a mage), hit milestone NINE in a 28-minute floor 4 run. I, on the other hand, hit milestone 6. And so, even though he died several times, he still got 200 more experience then me.\n\n\n\nThe idea of Healer seems boring.\n\n\nSpoiler: The idea of healer seems boring\n\n\n\nBeing a Healer implies standing still and occasionally clicking your adaptive blade to throw down a circle. Then, you'll place a mana flux (or over flux if you're a fancy boi). Then, you'll use a spirit leap. Then, you'll rinse and repeat, with occasional ornate zombie swording or pressing drop.\n\nHowever, there's something that typically replaces the word \"Healer\", and it implies different things: Support. Support implies several things. One is healing allies, two is buffs like strength buffs or ability buffs, and three is summoning allies to aid you in battle. Now this seems much more fun then Healer. I feel Healer could benefit greatly from something even as simple as renaming it to \"Support\". It would give people a different view on it. It would bring to light the fact that there should always be more to do then click, click again, use a spirit leap, then repeat.\n\n\n\nThere isn't enough stuff for a Support class.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Healer lacks identity\n\n\n\nI feel if Support items were added to the game, it would make the class seem more enticing and feel more interesting to play. As of right now there's only two items in the ENTIRE GAME that might be considered support: the Reaper Scythe and the Weird Tuba. Those both have interesting concepts, but are lacking in the feel of a definitive support class item. Mage has the Bonzo staff. Tank has the Earth Shard. Berserker has the Silent Death, and Archer has, well, every bow. Healer has the ornate zombie sword. Nothing else. Every class has one, and every class uses it. Healer lacks identity, and support items can give it that.\n\n\n\nNow, I'm done complaining. Time for some ideas.\n\n\nIdea number one: Shaman's Staff\n\nThe Shaman's Staff would be an epic/legendary staff that specializes in summoning animals to fight for you. It would be a rare drop from Floor 4, and be obtainable in Obsidian Chests and Emerald Chests only, at a price of 1,50,000 coins (epic) and 3,000,000 coins (legendary). - looks like a Blaze Rod (nerfed & changed, as suggested by @Sun_wk and @Ikonyx\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Epic Shaman's Staff\n\n\n\nShaman's Staff\nGear score:+700 (980)\nDamage: +100 (+140)\nStrength: +80 (+112)\n\nIntelligence: +300 (+420)\n\nItem Ability: Summon RIGHT CLICK\nWhile in dungeons, summon a pack of wolves from the Nether to help you fight. Wolves copy double your HP stat and bite enemies for 10,000 damage. \nSummons 5 wolves\nWolves despawn after 30 seconds\nUp to 20 wolves at once\nCosts 20% of your max mana\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Legendary Shaman's Staff\n\n\n\nShaman's Staff\nGear score: 700 (1050)\nDamage: +100 (+150)\nStrength: +80 (+120)\n\nIntelligence: +300 (+450)\n\nItem Ability: Summon RIGHT CLICK\nWhile in dungeons, summon a pack of wolves from the Nether to help you fight.

Wolves copy double your HP stat and bite enemies for 10,000 damage.\nSummons 5 wolves\nWolves despawn after 30 seconds\nUp to 20 wolves at once\nCosts 20% of your max mana\n\n\n\nIdea number two: Healing Staff\n\nThe Healing Staff would be a rare staff that specializes in giving large stat boosts to a singular player at the cost of mana. It would shoot out a beam made of particles It can be crafted in the Melon collection with three enchanted melon blocks and two enchanted blaze rods. It is not a dungeons item. - Looks like a golden shovel.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Rare Healing Staff\n\n\n\nHealing Staff\nHealth: +100\n\nIntelligence: +300\n\nItem Ability: Heal\nPunch a player to target them with your staff. Then, left click to being healing the player. Heals for 1o% of their max HP per second, and costs 10% of your max mana per second. Maximum range of 12 blocks.\n\n\n\nIdea number three: Totems\n\nTotems would be placeable statues, similar to an Overflux. It would varius buffs to people within its radius for a temporary period of time (time is doubled by Bubblegum). All totems are epic and unlocked in the wizard's quests (idk what they are but it seems like it would work). - Looks like an armor stand. \n\nAn example of what a totem might be:\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Strengthening Totem\n\n\n\nStrengthening Totem\nItem Ability: Deploy\nPlace a totem for 60s buffing up to 5 players within 18 blocks.\nCosts 50% of max mana.\nOnly one totem applies per player.\n\nTotem Buff: Strengthening\nGrants +10% crit damage and +10% strength. Increase weapon and bow refinement stat boosts by 5%. Grants 25 strength and 25 crit damage.\n\n\n\nIdea number four: Calls (by @YellowCat200)\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Calls\n\n\n\nCalls are something similar to a weird tuba. There's several of them, one for every main stat (hp, def, int, cd, cc, str, spe). Using it would give buffs of its specific stat to up to 5 players within a certain radius. Once you collect four Calls, you can use the secret ability, Call of the Wild, which buffs all stats for a short period of time at the cost of 50% of your max mana (60s cooldown). Calls are dropped from animals which correspond to the stat boost (wolves for cd, cows for defense, pigs for hp, sheep for int, etc) and look like dyes (green for hp, blue for defense, purple for int, black for cd, yellow for cc, red for str, and white for speed).\n\n\n\nIdea number five: Battle Horn (by @Ferrothorn88)\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Battle Horn\n\n\n\nBattle Horn is a rare item that you can use to \"dishearten\" your enemies. It plays a sound (ender dragon roar?) that effects all monsters within a radius with weakness and slowness for a temporary period. It would be crafted using golden teeth and enchanted mutton.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion\nI think that Healer is in a bad place right now. I seriously think that it could benefit from new items and from being changed into a Support class rather then a Healer class. I doubt any of these ideas will be noticed by admins, and none of the will be added. I just felt like I wanted to express some ideas that I had to see if anyone agrees with me. I spent some time on this post and I hope it does well.\n\nPlease post any comments or criticisms you have in the replies."}, {"title": "What stage of the game am I and what should I do next?", "body": "Hey all!

Half our team left before the boss, and we failed during the fight. As I was teleported back into the dungeons hub, I naturally held my finger on my sprint button (which was Q, and I changed drop to P, to avoid dropping items) as I entered the lobby, I saw my aote which I was apparently holding, fling out of my hotbar and I heard the pop of someone else picking it up. I do not know why my key binds suddenly switched back, and they worked fine like a second later, but for some reason it glitched possibly because I was holding it down or something. \n\nFor a bit of explanation, my laptop is quite old, and usually operates at around 20 or less fps, often dropping under 10. I was really trying to avoid having to use forge, or download badlion client or any of those add-ons, simply to save my frame rate. I have now changed my mind, and will download one of these next time I'm on. \n\nBack to what happened, I was lucky enough to see who picked it up, as there was only a single person standing at spawn; puggly05. Unfortunately, less than 10 seconds after I partied them, they must have been kicked for afk. I have checked their sky lea, but they haven't enabled API, so I cannot confirm 100% it was them. However, I am nearly certain it was them, as I saw and heard them pick it up. \n\nSo, if you are reading this @Puggly05 (I think that's your account) please accept my invites next time I'm on, I'd really love to get it back.

Normally, Dreadlord Sword is fine, since Telekinesis only costs 100 Coins to apply.

This is because the Telekinesis enchant doesn't work on stuff like Slayer Drops. The problem here is the ability of the Dreadlord Sword shoots out a Wither Skull that deals AoE damage on contact. And if those Slayer Drops are in the radius of the Dreadlord ability, they're dead. This also becomes a problem in Dungeons wherein all drops aren't affected by Telekinesis, so you'll have no choice but to kick your level 2 Mage unless you want him to yeet your drops. The last place where this could become a problem is in The End. Normally, The End would be fine even with all those people going in and religiously using Dreadlord Sword to farm Zealots. The problem arises once a Special Zealot spawns. Telekinesis normally works on Specials, but if the person who killed the Special isn't the one who spawned it, the eye drops onto the ground. As I've established earlier, this is bad since one more Dreadlord Ability will literally yeet the summoning eye off the face of Hypixel Skyblock.

Don't call me a salty archer who can't afford the new stuff. Just read the damn post please.\n\nReason 1: Versatility is Gone\n\nWhat these types of games do best isn't how fun they are from grinding or accomplishments, it's the fact that you have so many different options that you can take for success. Skyblock has all the elements except for this.\n\nRegarding especially Mage, everybody knows that Pigman isn't great (it's good, but pretty situational), Yeti Sword is great, Spirit Spectre is overpowered, and all the other mage weapons are garbage. The \"mana nerf\" isn't something to consider due to how Mages can retrieve the mana extremely quickly.\n\nAs a somewhat MMORPG game, Skyblock is supposed to give plenty of options for players to choose from, whether it would be to deal a lot of damage, assist others, or absorb damage as much as you can. What happened with Mage actually destroyed this essence. Mage was the only class which had versatile options to choose from (will get to other classes in a bit) and that was completely removed.\n\nBefore this update, Mage could use Frozen Scythe to deal damage plus help slow down enemies that are potentially dangerous. A Mage could use Bonzo's Staff/Yeti Sword to wipe out large crowds. A Mage could use Pigman to deal a large amount of damage to high health enemies. Of course, there were flaws: Because of the Frozen Scythe nerf, Bonzo's Staff was pretty much a better FS without the slow effect, which doesn't make much of a difference in reality. (Compare the slow effect to the one of Voodoo's. That's a good slow effect.) Because of how Pigman was allowed to spam and grants defense, Mages were able to shred through bosses/minibosses while also becoming unkillable themselves.\n\nWhat they did was make all except the Yeti Sword irrelevant and introduced an even more overpowered item called the Spirit Spectre. Immediately, all of these other options are invalidated because they weren't worth their cost: Frozen scythe doesn't do AOE, Bonzo's didn't deal enough damage, Voodoo targets too little and is does waaay too little damage, and Pigman is cumbersome and risky. Even Yeti Sword is slow due to its cooldown. The Spirit Spectre outclasses Bonzo in damage, Frozen Scythe in both damage and versatility, Voodoo in both damage and speed, Pigman in range and speed, and Yeti Sword in speed.\n\nMMORPG games are supposed to have plenty of viable options, not just a single strategy that is incredibly superior over everything else. Mage used to have this characteristic, not including Pigman.\n\nRegarding other classes, they didn't even have any options. Even now, Tank, Berserker, and Healer are still limited in what they can do. Archers on the other hand is a very special case that I will go over in the reason 3.\n\nReason 2: Most of the Classes STILL Don't Have Any Options\n\nThis is shown in Archer (kind of), Tank, Berserker, and especially Healer. If it isn't obvious, all Archer has is a good bow (machine gun, mosquito, spirit, bonemerang) which all relatively do the same thing. All Tank has is his defensive armor (perfect or super heavy) and the Earth Shard, which most of the community can't even use yet. All Berserker has is his good swords (silent death, midas, aotd). Healer, the worst case of them all, only has power orbs and his ability.\n\nThis update only shown light upon Mage, which had already gotten a lot of light even with the nerf, and Archer, which didn't bring up anything brand new to experiment with. The three other classes barely gain any improvements, with Tank gaining Super Heavy and a weapon that they probably can't even use yet. Berserker and Healer actually gain n o t h i n g.\n\nUpdates shouldn't just shine on a specific set of classes; it should grant new improvements/strategies to all classes. However, improvements are most likely not the best choice to go for here because of how we already have very strong options: It is the new strategies that should be focused on.\n\nA bunch of ideas that you could add to diversify how each class is played can vary from new abilities or new effects. For example, a cool item would be \"Hook, Line, and Sinker.\" It would be a sword that has the right-click ability of \"Hookshot.\" It launches a projectile that would cling onto a wall or hit an enemy. If it clings onto a wall, then you would get dragged to there (quite like an actual hookshot). If you hit an enemy, it gets stunned for a second along with a secondary property. If you were sneaking while you launched the hook, the enemy would be dragged to you. If you weren't, then you would drag yourself to the enemy.\n\nThis gives both Tank and Berserker a new strategy to use. Berserker could use this item to charge into battle or to bring in a ranged enemy to slay. Tank could also use this item to divert enemies from your teammates. Ideas like this should be implemented in order to let more strategies to be created.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Some other ideas\n\n\n\nSoulstealer Skull (rare drop from Withermancer)\n\nLaunches a projectile that deals base 5000 magic damage that scales slowly and has an AOE effect radius of 2 blocks. It heals you for 1% of all damage that you dealt. If you are a Healer, it also heals nearby players for 1% of the damage you dealt. (Cooldown of 10 seconds)\n\nCan be used a healing item for Mages or a support/damage item for Healers. In order for effectiveness, you need to hit as many enemies as possible.\n\nCall of the Wild (rare drop from Thorn)\n\nGrants a different buff to nearby teammates depending on your class.\n\nBerserker: +50 strength and +20 speed\nTank: +75 defense\nHealer: +100 health and heals for 2.5% of their max HP per second.\nArcher: +75 crit damage and 25% chance to dodge attacks\nMage: +200 intelligence and restores 200 mana immediately.\n\nMana cost: 150. Doesn't affect yourself. Lasts for 10 seconds, cooldown of 15 seconds.\n\nCan be used as a support item for all classes.\n\nBandages (rare secrets loot)\n\nClick onto another Player to heal them for 200 health + 1% of their max HP (cooldown of 1 second). You can also click directly below to heal yourself for 1% of their max HP.

Also grants a 5% absorption shield to players around you.\n\nMana cost: 100. Lasts for 20 seconds. Cooldown: 30 seconds\n\nCan be used by Tank for more defense or Healer for health.\n\nFiery Rune (rare drop from the Mage in Scarf's fight)\n\nThrows a snowball. While active, it sits there with a trigger radius of 3 blocks. Once an enemy walks into the trap, it blows up, dealing base 50000 magic damage. Automatically detonates after 10 seconds.\n\nMana cost: 100 mana. Cooldown: 5 seconds\n\nWarrior's Sword (rare drop from the Warrior in Scarf's fight)\n\n+180 damage\n+160 strength\n+50 crit damage\n\nRight click ability: Reckless charge. Dashes forward at a high velocity. Upon collision, it deals AOE damage of 1 radius that deals your highest damage recently and stuns them for 2 seconds.\n\nEpic dungeon item\n\nBow of a Thousand Shots\n\n+150 damage\n+100 strength\n\nItem Ability: Volley. Charging 1 second over a fully charged bow shot arms another arrow, able to put in up to 5 extra arrows.\n\nEpic dungeon item\n\n\n\nReason 3: The Method of Adding Items is Horrible\n\nEspecially for Archer which also applies to Mage, the way they had added new items was terrible. When it comes to a game mode that has plenty of different armor sets, items shouldn't completely outclass other weapons unless there is a large difference in GRINDING (not cost). For example, an override is fair with Bonzo vs Yeti Sword because the amount of grinding to get Yeti Sword is insanely larger than Bonzo's.\n\nArcher's special case mentioned before is how he got improvements, but none of them actually change gameplay. Spirit bow is just a direct improvement from Machine Gun. Bonemerang (if it behaves like a normal bow) is just a direct improvement from Spirit Bow. There is no change in strategy.\n\nThe only bow that diverges from the idea of a single shot is Hurricane, which is pretty good. However, the lack of diversity between weapons is bad game design. This also applies to Mage, with the Spirit Spectre outclassing literally every single other mage weapon in all aspects.\n\nIn order to diversify gameplay, each weapon should be given their own unique uses/properties unless there is a large enough gap between the weapons. Regarding Archer, the gap between Epic Machine Gun and Spirit bow is only one floor and the difference between Bonemerang and Spirit Bow isn't even a full floor. There are differences in time/difficulty of grinding, but they aren't large enough to be considered a good choice to add.\n\nOne change could be to nerf Spirit Bow's damage output, but also have the unique property of being able to pierce targets and not have reduced damage, like piercing their souls. It could also pierce defense, but that's up to admins to decide. The unique property of not losing damage from piercing would make a different strategy of properly positioning yourself to hit as many targets as possible with your strong arrow.\n\nBonemerang could also be a weapon that isn't used like a bow, but a boomerang that you can throw while you have it but you have to wait for it to come back. (If it does behave like this, then ignore this bit.) It would, of course, have its damage output increased by a lot but a strategy of chucking the Bonemerang, swapping to a bow for a couple of shots, then throw the Bonemerang.\n\nLooking at the Spirit Spectre, a cool difference would be to have a \"spirit level,\" quite like Minecraft Dungeons. The more enemies you kill, the more you fill up the spirit guage. Instead of costing mana, it would cost part of your spirit guage. (It would also have to be increased in damage in order to compensate for the cost of killing enemies before being able to use this ability.) A new strategy with this change would be to build up your spirit guage slowly, then release it all once the time is right. It would also prevent the case of Spirit Spectre automatically overriding all the other mage weapons: the other mage weapons would be the support for Spirit Spectre's ability.\n\nReason 4: The Boss is Horribly Designed\n\nThe decoy method for the Floor 4 boss is very convenient to use, but it sucks both the effort put into the boss and the skill of completing Floor 4 all the way out. However, the intended strategy for beating the Floor 4 is incredibly inconvenient, inconsistent, unfair, and long. You can't just remove decoys from bosses: you need to also adjust the boss in order to make it less unfair.\n\nWolves deal great damage and below average health, Cows deal ok damage and above average health, Rabbits move incredibly fast, Sheep self-destruct, Chickens blow you up, and Bats can swarm. As of now, Wolves and Cows are irrelevant. Rabbits are extremely annoying. Sheep and Chickens are annoying and usually not detected. Bats are the only threat of this boss, and they are way too powerful of a threat.\n\nInstead of having bats be the only threat in existence, there are two ways to handle them: either reduce their damage output or to reduce their health to mimic the health of actual bats. (About 50k damage) This would let Archers/Mages disperse the swarm if they have reduced health, or the Tanks can go through their damage output.\n\nRegarding the other animals, the rabbits shouldn't be as obnoxious as they are: at least make them able to be hit, or lower their health in order to let them be dealt with easier. Cows are fine, due to how their herd can definitely run over a player. Wolves, in my opinion, don't deal as much damage as you'd expect them to: they feel like cows except with less health. Why chickens can use lightning completely mystify me, it should just blow up like one of the chicken mines upon contact. Sheeps are also fine, but the warning isn't really shown: maybe add a sound effect?\n\nRegarding the Spirit Bear and Bow, it is ridiculously hard to hit Thorn especially when getting swarmed over by rabbits, wolves, and whatnot. Spirit Boots would help to reach him due to the fly ability, but it's still hard to hit. Make it so the Spirit Bow can't hit any enemy except for Thorn, (heard about shots being blocked by rabbits) and maybe allow more shots (which upon hitting, it disintegrates).\n\nReason 5: Berserker Still Sucks\n\nBerserker is meant to charge into battle, dealing massive damage. However, Archers can deal only marginally less damage while being completely safe while Berserkers need to approach. Berserkers especially struggle against enemies like the Dreadlord and Skeleton Master if they aren't quick enough, which the \"Hook, Line, and Sinker\" could help. However, I believe the struggle of Berserkers lie in the fact that they die easily, which is very deadly when you consider how Berserker has to get up close with the enemy.\n\nTwo things should happen with Berserker:\n\nOne: Increase his damage output. When a ranged class outdamages a melee one, something is definitely wrong. Maybe just 20% more melee damage?\n\nTwo: Increase his \"EHP.\" You could increase the defense they get, but that would only invalidate Tank. Berserker would just become a damage-dealing Tank. Instead, I would give him a second passive (he's the only class with less than 2 passives) that increase the effectiveness on Lifesteal. Rewarding Berserker's high risk high reward behavior, the regain of health from a couple of slices would let Berserker be a more Berserker-like playstyle rather than just melee Archer.\n\nTL;DR: Read the bolded stuff."}, {"title": "Where do you post ideas for skyblock?", "body": "I have an AMAZING idea"}, {"title": "what type of potion is best for alchemy xp?", "body": "by this i mean, which kind of potion could i keep brewing for the cheapest alchemy xp?\n\nexample is\nred potion costs $10 to brew, gives 20xp.\ngreen potion costs $5 to brew, gives 15xp.\n\nso green is better"}, {"title": "what reforge for talisman as a healer", "body": "as a healer, i tend to place down mana flux a lot\n\nBut the mana cost is so high i switched to a dmg based talisman reforge.\n\nshould i go for tankiness or dmg as a healer\n\nsky.lea.moe/winner_trollguy"}, {"title": "Does anyone know how to download the skyblock mods like Aspect of the end, AOTD, and more", "body": "Does anyone know how to download the skyblock mods like Aspect of the end, AOTD, and more"}, {"title": "[NEW] Hypixel Skyblock Website!", "body": "Here is a link to a brand new Hypixel Skyblock Website!\nIt has every post about with over 1K views on the Hypixel Skyblock forums, along with every YT video with 5k+ views and 10k+ for any other social media platforms.

These three will determine which of the new abilities a player will be able to unlock. However, once you're experienced enough, you might be able to combine the buffs you get from pledging your allegiance to a faction.\n\n\u25ba Factions\nFactions are a brand new way to enhance your preferred playstyle throughout all of SkyBlock. Whether you're someone who enjoys combat, building, exploring, or discovering secrets, there'll be a faction that suits your needs. You can't manually choose a faction, but your actions will affect what faction you'll be in. Players that reach a high amount of neutral and passive mob kills such as fairies, zealots, farm animals, etc. constantly die in Dungeons, and are low in collections shall be placed into the \"Evil\" faction. Being \"evil\" will allow you to pursue the power of the decrepit mask. On the other side of the spectrum, defeating enemies such as slayer bosses, dragons, or dungeons bosses, but skipping fairies in Dungeons will place you into the \"Good\" faction. Being \"good\" will grant you the ability to purse the powers of Pulse magic. Finally, there's players who prove themselves to be well-rounded and prove themselves to be worthy by being high up in several collections, but also focus on every aspect of skyblock, such as slayers, dungeons, skills, etc. will be able to become \"Neutral.\" Being neutral will grant you the ability to obtain a Guardian's Spear.\n\n\n\u25ba Decrepit Mask (Evil Allegiance)\nBy having an \"evil\" playstyle, you'll be able to unleash the power of one of the brand new three main abilities called the Decrepit Mask. To obtain this item, you'll have to speak to an NPC in the graveyard named Brand. Once he deems you're worthy of him, you'll be able to interact with him and he'll give you a quest. The tasks in this quest are difficult, but the rewards are worth it. You'll be tested to see the limits of what you'll do for power.\n\n\nSpoiler: Brand's Gauntlet\n\n\n\nBrand's Gauntlet requires the following tasks, but keep in mind some are kept secret as to not spoil the surprise!\n\nSet up 20 pig 8 or higher tier minions on your island at once\nKill 20 players in the Colosseum using an unenchanted weapon and armor\nKill 100 fairies in Dungeons\nBring the blood of 150 passive mobs and use it to ruin Marco's flower field.\nSpam call Maddox\nDefeat every villager in the Hub in a battle.\n\n\n\nThe mask does not take the space of an armor slot, and grants you the following abilities :\n+20% natural health regen\n-70% poison damage taken\n-40% wither damage taken\n+5% permanent strength buff\n+5% buff to all stats during the night/dark places\n-5% debuff to all stats in bright places/day\n+10% combat exp boost during the night\n-20% healing done to others\n+10% arrow damage\n\n\u25ba Pulse (Good Allegiance)\nBy having a \"good\" playstyle, you'll be able to look within yourself and discover the hidden power of Pulse. However, you can't do this on your own. Once he decides you're worthy, an NPC named Billiam will visit your island. If you speak to him, he'll give you a quest similar to Brand's. This quest will take place in a completely separate island, where you have nothing but the clothes on your back. All your skills will be reset, and you have to start from scratch.\n\n\nSpoiler: Billiam's Intense Training\n\n\n\nBilliam puts you through a very difficult training regimen composed of the following tasks. (Not all are included to keep some a surprise!)\n\nGet every skill to level 10 with nothing but your bare hands. (Not including Mining)\nUnlock the first stage of Pulse, Overpower by defeating Billiam.\nRun through Billiam's parkour course with no buffs/speed increases in under 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\nReach mining 10 using Overpower.\nObtain the second stage of pulse, Gold-Powered Punches by defeating Billiam (Pulse Form)\nDefeat Brand's Minions using your newly-learned powers.\n\n\n\nLearning pulse grants you a large amount of new powers, and some buffs too!\n+Overpower Ability (Shift/Right-click with fist)\n>Smashes the ground around you, knocking enemies back and instantly mining a 5x5x5 area around you. Decent amount of damage.\n+Gold-Powered Punches Ability (Triple right-click with fist)\n>Punches with the leverage and weight of gold, dealing huge damage. Great for single targets. Strikes up to 5 blocks in front of you.\n+Lighting Cross Split Ability (Right click, left click, right click with fist)\n>Deals 60% extra damage when at 25% or less HP. Can only be used at 50% or less HP, and does 42000 damage. Only strikes 1 block in front of you.\n+20% HP boost\n+20% healing boost to others\n+15% natural health regen\n+10% strength boost\n>Take extra damage from players with the Decrepit Mask, but can counter-attack.\n\n\u25ba Spirit Guardians & Spears (Neutral Allegiance)\nThis is the final ability a player can gain from their allegiance to a faction. Once you're worthy of such a skill, you need to find Broseph in the Precursor Ruins. He'll tell you how to locate an item called a \"Guardian Spear.\" However, finding a Guardian Spear is easier said than done. Even once you've got once, you'll have to go through a set of challenges to keep it, because other people want the power too.\n\n\nSpoiler: Guardian's Trials\n\n\n\nThe lengths you'll have to go to in order to become worthy of the spear include but aren't limited to :\n\nDefeating Brand\nDestroying other Guardian Spears\nLearning your Guardian's abilities\nDestroying other Guardian wielders\nProving yourself to Broseph\nFulfilling your goal as a Guardian wielder by infiltrating the mayor's mafia\n\n\n\nSpirit guardian's buffs and abilities differ depending on who you are. There are 8 unique primary abilities a Guardian can have, and 8 secondary abilities. Even then, you can go further and one day find out that you've come across a Spirit Eulogy Spear. If you're worthy enough, using the Eulogy Spear will allow you to access one of 6 possible tertiary Guardian abilities. Every ability comes with its own unique buffs. Primary abilities are activated by using [Shift + Right Click x2] Secondaries are activated by using [Shift, Right Click, Left Click]\n\n\nSpoiler: Primary Abilities\n\n\n\nCreeper King\n>Shift and double right click to plant a bomb on a block you choose. Any enemy that steps on this bomb will be instantly killed (Deals high damage to bosses but does not kill them)\n+20% intelligence buff\n+15% ranged damage boost\n+60% immunity to explosions \n\nSea Breeze\n>Using your ability while in range of an enemy will make you invincible for a very brief period of time, and while invincible you can lauch a very powerful attack.\n+50 max speed cap\n+300% speed in water\n+Using string to activate your ability will deal +20% damage\n\nStardust Steel\n>All melee weapons gain a secondary charged ability that deals more damage the longer it's charged.

You can always change the factions you're allied with, but be mindful that you can only be in two at once. Being in both the Good and Evil factions will grant you the powers of a Spire Lord. Being both Neutral and Evil/Good allows you to reap all the rewards at once, but doesn't give you a special title. However, certain Guardians have a higher chance of manifesting depending if you're pledged to either Evil or Good.\n\n\u25ba Multiple Guardians\nYou cannot have multiple guardians. However, you can find a rare item named the Gilded Apple to reset your guardian. Keep in mind, this means you'll need to find a new Guadian Spear.\n\n\u25ba Gilded Apples & Spire Lords\nBecoming a Spire Lord is no small feat, and tons of skill is required to handle both the powers of the Decrepit Mask and Pulse. However, if you do manage to do it, you'll be rewarded with a 1% boost to all item reforge and talisman bonuses, along with a 3% boost to all stats, no matter the time of day.\nIn order to get a Gilded Apple, you simply need to defeat a Guardian wielder without using your guardian. However, they only have a 20% chance of dropping, and you cannot fight the same Guardian wielder twice for an apple. This is to prevent farming them. The wielder may be a player or NPC.\n\nThanks so much for reading, this is a submission for @Swap_MC 's contest and patch notes will be coming soon that include helpful suggestions I get from anybody."}, {"title": "What is the best minion to make an afk minion farm for", "body": "Title ^"}, {"title": "Skyblock Map arts", "body": "Heyo just wondering if i make a map art on my island will it show up on the hub island or other players"}, {"title": "Dungeons Question...", "body": "What Armour Set's And Weapon's Are Good for Dungeons???"}, {"title": "harp", "body": "Y does melody's hair not work until u finish all the songs, there is then no point in buying it, I just wasted 450k cause i didn't know that and live in Australia so i have way to high ping to even imagine doing it.

The community\nIt's shit.\n\nCompared to what it was like a year ago, skyblock players have made this game the most toxic shit hole in the server.\n\nA couple days ago, I returned to skyblock from a few days of playing other stuff.\nI see a good hurricane bow that's going for 1 mil on BIN. It doesn't have the kills maxed and the kills don't go up when I kill things, either.\nI ask if anyone has the same problem and I shit you not, 3 people immediately start flaming me for being a \"noob\".\nI check their stats and none of them have skill averages higher than 24 (mine is 30+).\nIt pisses me off, that these guys with minimal experience are fixed on some wrong opinion and are willing to argue to the death about it and make ad hominem remarks.\n\nAnd it's not just in scenarios like that, people get toxic for no fvcking reason.\nI have /togglechat activated most of the time, but holy hell, whenever I turn it off theres some poor non getting attacked or some other dude getting hate for just having a fvcking opinion.\nWhat is wrong with people?\n\nI'm not saying I'm not toxic, but I don't actively try to bully people for no good reason.\n\nCompare skyblock to bedwars, skywars, and duels.\nI've been playing with a trackpad (mouse out of batteries) and obviously I have klunky movements, but not a single person has been toxic to me today. No \"L\"s, no \"git gud\"s, no \"e z\"s, and no directed hate messages.\nBW/SW/duels players aren't nice like your grandma, either, but they aren't aggressively aimed at ruining someone's day, unlike a surprisingly large number skyblock players.\n\n\n2. The updates/patches\nThe speed of updates and bug fixes is good enough; you guys don't need to spam shit like \"oMg nO cOnTenT\".\nPeople who do that are entitled little kids who can't find something fun to do on a game that is basically sandbox, where you're free to do whatever.\nI, like others, obviously got tired of the \"lack of new content\" before dungeons, but I found other stuff to do while waiting for it and haven't publicly complained about the \"slow updates\" at all.\n\nThen there's the updates themselves.\nHoly shit, the admins really overdo things.\nThis is not to spread hate or anything, but I disagree with the way they do stuff.\nToo many of all the updates and patches drastically shift the meta and ignite fights within the skyblock community.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but I think the way another company (Supercell, creator of clash royale and brawl stars) does stuff is better: monthly, regular, and planned balance changes with sneak peeks and relatively small alterations.\nCompare this to skyblock updates, which are irregular, unpredictable, and meta-changing-- no, meta-overwriting-- half the time.\n\n\n3. The staff\nAgain, not to spread hate or anything.\nBut.\nNigh nothing is done to scammers.\nToo many dupers, boosters, and (illegal, might I mention) irl traders run free.\nI'm sure the hypixel team is doing their best to get rid of rule breakers, but I feel that the problem is too big and more needs to be done.\n\nThe staff rarely interacts with the player base, and when they do, it's sometimes Minikloon saying dumb shit like \"how did I get here\" after going afk in a prototype lobby (real story), or him doing a kloonboat giveaway (real), or someone spawning giant zombies in hub 1 (also real).\nNot to hate on them, because Minikloon and the rest of the devs are awesome for working hard to make this game fun for us, but this is kind of ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\nThat's all.\nThanks for coming to my TED talk."}, {"title": "ACTUAL max magic find calculated", "body": "actual best possible magic find\n:\n10 magic find \"weekend\"\n+\nmax pet score(7)\n+\nmagic find 4 potion(75)\n+\nSlayer\u00a9 energy drink(10)\n+\nlucky clover(7)\n*\n(\nnight\n+\nrenowned mushroom armour(4%*3)\n(or spooky festival + renowned bat person set(4%*3))\n+\nepic or legendary blaze pet lvl 100(all stats increased by 20% while in the blazing fortress)\n)\n=\n157,08 magic find for the cheap cheap prize of ~80m-130m(not sure about the pets price)\nTell me in the comments if i calculated something wrong."}, {"title": "CAN SOMEONE LIST ALL BEST ENCHANTS FOR SWORD AND BOW?

And how can we fix it?", "body": "Disclaimer: Please read the post before replying.\n\nThe Magma Boss is clearly intended for new players. It is the first boss they should be experiencing in Skyblock, and the items dropped by the boss show that. The Ember Armor, Ember Rod. and Magma Cube Pet are all low level items that are a perfect thing to strive for as a new player. The unfortunate truth is a new player will never earn those items on their own, and are forced to buy those items from the auction house because somebody in Dragon Armor kills the boss in half a second. I am aware they made it so the Magma boss now takes 2000 damage, plus a percentage of the max damage dealt. But that doesn't make it any easier for new players to actually get drops.\n\nMy solution? First of all, increase the boss's health by 25k for each person in the lobby. This will make it so the boss doesn't die as quick, because even now it dies in less than 10 seconds. Second, reduce the time in between spawns from 2 hours, to 1 hour. In my opinion, waiting 2 hours for a boss that drops honestly mediocre loot is a little absurd. Edit: @DerSpeedfreak suggested that instead of the timer, there should be a magma cube kill total like the endstone golem has. The third and final solution would be to give the drops of the magma boss to a random player if they reach a certain amount of damage. Each time the boss is killed, it is guaranteed to drop 1 Ember Rod, 1 Magma Cube Pet (Epic or Legendary), and 1 Piece of Ember Armor. In addition, anyone who reaches the damage threshold would be rewarded 1-2 Ember Fragments, and 5-10 Enchanted Magma Cream. This will make it so newer players can ACTUALLY get drops, and in a fair way. Gone are the days of Mr. Superior killing the magma boss, robbing the newer players of weapons and armor meant for them, just so Mr. Superior can earn some extra pocket change on the AH.\n\nPlease tell me your thoughts! \nAnd if you don't have any thoughts to contribute, but still like the post, then don't be afraid to leave a bump as it really helps."}, {"title": "AOTD's Ability Info", "body": "So, I RECENTLY got a Aspect of the dragons and don't know it very well.

Whether the nerf was too hard is a different question\n\nReaper scythe has been thrown in the trash for too long\nIt\u2019s worth 10 - 13 mil rn. I remember about a month ago when the price was 28 mil. The reaper scythe is garbage now and it has waited over 6 months for its buff\nIt\u2019s a level 7 weapon for slayers\nYou know, like the overflux and mosquito\n\n\nIt\u2019s worthless\nIt\u2019s no debate that the 100% skill copy was op\nAnd the AI is everything but perfect. Sometimes they will have trouble targeting what you hit or jumping up blocks, specifically slabs. And sometimes they just don\u2019t move at all. They constantly get in your way of hitting things and the zombies prioritize killing the mob that is hitting you rather than the mob that you\u2019re hitting. This could be inefficient when you\u2019re fighting multiple enemies and your zombies keep changing targets.\nAnd I don\u2019t really mind the scythe not having strength since it\u2019s mostly a support weapon for tanks\nBut give it at least +30 or 40 strength and a 50% skill copy\nMany youtubers were expecting this to be a big part for dungeons but nothing has changed about it and for most it\u2019s not that good\nAnd also make the baby zombies last a minute\nLosing 2% per second essentially lasts 50 seconds so 60 seconds is better\n\nThe ghoul pet seemed to be a way to buff it, but it wasn\u2019t efficient. It\u2019s clear that the admins didn\u2019t want anything op to come out of the scythe, like any game breaking bugs. The legendary variant, and the legendary only, buffs the scythe. Making the zombies last 100% longer at its highest level. Seems good at first but it honestly isn\u2019t. Having a pet that boosts a support weapon is already a bad pet to choose. Most tanks would rather go with a pet like whale, turtle, or golem\n\n\nBuff the reaper scythe\n@Minikloon @Jayavarmen"}, {"title": "Selling flower minion", "body": "Im too lazy to go spam the hub chats. 6.5 mil just leave a reply under the post or friend me IGN: XKirem."}, {"title": "5th floor miniboss??", "body": "I'm not sure, but i think every 2 floors there is another miniboss added. floor 1 starts with the angry archeologist and the lost adventurer, and then in floor 3 the shadow assassin gets added into the mix.

I would do lots of floor 2's and 3's with my friend and usually make a lot of money. My class was mage, and I used bonzo staff. Now, after the nerf, bonzo staff is just completely useless. Skyblock's problem is that everything always gets nerfed WAY TOO MUCH. Bonzo staff is now completely unusable and no one will ever want one again. Also, by \"fixing the over-powered mage problem\", they have created a new one. Mage is literal CRAP. Now, floor four seems really fun, but very very hard. I understand that it's meant to be challenging, but nerfing players so much that it's almost impossible to complete it is horrible. Some items are meant to be good. For say, the pigman sword. It was super good for dungeons as a mage since it did tons of damage, and yes, this is over-powered. Yet, the sword costs 20 million coins. Now that the pigman has been nerfed to the ground, a 20 million sword has turned into a mere 6 mil huddle of trash no one wants to use anymore, just like the reaper scythe. Next, this update completely ruined people's gameplay. F4 would still be really challenging with the old bonzo staff. Now, a personal example, yesterday I saw my epic sheep had about 2 days left on it's upgrading, so I went and bought enough enchanted sugarcane to make it level 100. Annnnd then, they nerf the bonzo staff. Welp, there goes 10 mil because staff doesn't know what they are doing. I've completely dropped everything mage and swapped to berserk. Oh wait! Berserk will probably get nerfed too! They might aswell just remove dungeons as a whole because everything is to over-powered...."}, {"title": "[Suggestion + Poll] Nerf Crypt Dreadlords on F4", "body": "^^^.\n\nThey do more damage than every miniboss, besides fb in yellow room, and boss in dungeons currently.

So I figured why not make a thread that calls out every reference in the game, because I like that sort of thing.\n\nThings will be split into difference categories:\nHypixel Games: References to other games on hypixel.\u200bOther Games: References to any games outside of minecraft.\u200bMedia: References to any social media thing (for example, youtubers).\u200bOther: References to anything else that doesn't fall in the other categories, if there is any for that.\u200b\nAlso, before I start, I just wanna say that idk if any of these are confirmed references. There are a few I'm guaranteed of, but most of these are just putting together similarities.\n\nHypixel Games\n\n\nSpoiler: Mega Walls\n\n\n\nPigman Sword\nThe Pigman Sword is a reference to the Pigman class. They both share the Burning Souls ability. However, the class' ability grants strength whereas the sword's ability grants defense.\n\nShaman Sword\nThe Shaman Sword is a reference to the Shaman class. While not a directly sharing similar abilities, the Shaman class does have an ability that summons wolves, which is referenced by the Shaman Sword being a recipe from the Wolf Slayer.\n\nZombie Sword\nThe Zombie Sword is a reference to the Zombie class. Its Circle of Healing ability is similar to the sword's Instant Heal ability. Both heal you and players (in the class' case, teammates) around you instantly.\n\nDreadlord Sword/Soulstealer Bow\nThe Dreadlord Sword and Soulstealer Bow are references to the Dreadlord class. Its Shadow Burst ability is similar to the sword's Dreadlord ability and the bow's passive. The class' Shadow Burst ability shoots 3 wither skulls. The sword's ability shoots one wither skull and the bow's passive replaces arrows with wither skulls (though in Mega Walls, left clicking the bow activates the ability, and in skyblock's case all arrows are just replaced).\n\nLeaping Sword/Silk-Edged Sword\nBoth swords are a reference to the Spider class. They all share the Leap ability.\n\nGolem Sword\nThe Golem Sword is a reference to the Golem class. They both share the Iron Punch ability.\n\nGolem armor\nThe Golem armor set is a reference to the Golem class. Its Iron Heart ability is similar to the armor's Absorption ability. The class' Iron Heart gives absorption after killing a player. The armor's Absorption ability gives absorption after killing a mob.\n\nExplosive Bow\nThe Explosive Bow is a reference to the Skeleton class. Its Explosive Arrow ability is similar to bow's Explosive Shot ability. Both are arrow shots that explode on impact.\n\nFrozen Scythe\nThe Frozen Scythe is a reference to the Snowman class. They both share the Ice Bolt ability, though in Mega Walls, the ability shoots three bolts per activation rather than one.\n\nSilent Death\nThe Silent Death is a reference to the Assassin class. They both share the Shadow Step ability.\n\nUltimate Enchant: Rend\nThe Rend enchant is a reference to the Renegade class. One of the class' abilities is called Rend, and you would left click your bow to rip the arrows out of players you shot, dealing extra dmg.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Lucky Skywars\n\n\n\nReaper Scythe\nThe Reaper Scythe is a reference to the Reaper Scythe item in Skywars' Lucky lab mode. In the lab mode, killing a player with the scythe spawns a zombie to help you. Killing a mob with the scythe gives you the option to spawn a zombie to help you. Idk if this is a reference to anything else though.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Pit\n\n\n\nStereo Pants\nStereo Pants are a reference to the Stereo Pants from The Pit.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Paintball\n\n\n\nJerry Event\nWhile not an item, the Jerry Event powerups are references to Paintball's killstreaks. The Strongarm powerup is a killstreak in Paintball. The Double Shot powerup is a reference to the Triple Shot killstreak (and iirc, it used to be a Triple Up in the Jerry Event but was toned down cause of lag). The Homing powerup is a reference to the Rezzus Hat's homing ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Main Lobby\n\n\n\nGrappling Hook\nThe Grappling Hook is a reference to the main lobby\u02bbs Grappling Hook gadget. The both do the same thing, but the skyblock Grappling Hook has a cooldown (though it can be removed with Bat Person armor).\n\nLaunch Pad\nThe launch pad is a reference to slime launch pads in the main lobby. The launch pads in the lobby will shoot you in a predetermined direction. The launch pads in skyblock will send you in the direct you\u02bbre facing (private islands) or to other islands (public islands).\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: AHN\n\n\n\nFrench Bread\nIdk if you can really count this as a reference, but the French Bread is a reference to the Alpha Hypixel Network. Players spammed the French Bread reaction in the mvp++ lounge of the Hypixel discord server during dungeons testing. Players who were able to beat Scarf in the AHN received a French Bread item in the normal skyblock server. You can also find a French Bread (placed, so not an actual item) in certain dungeon rooms.\n\n\n\nOther Games\n\n\nSpoiler: League of Legends\n\n\n\nRunaan's Bow/Hurricane Bow\nThe Runaan's Bow and Hurricane Bow are references to the Runaan's Hurricane item. The item's Wind's Fury ability is similar to the bow's Triple Shot ability. The item allows basic attacks to shoot 2 addition bolts, each dealing 40% of your damage. The bow shoots 2 additional arrows, each dealing 40% of your damage. Hurricane bow is similar in where it shoots multiple shots, but it doesn\u02bbt have decreased damage on its extra shots.\n\nSpirit Mask/Kindred\nThe Spirit Mask and Kindred helmet are references to the champion Kindred. The skin used for the masks resemble that of Kindred. Idk what exactly the ability is referencing, but my guess would be Kindred's Lamb's Respite ability. Lamb's Respite prevents nearby teammates from going below 10% hp, whereas the mask's Second Wind ability grants damage immunity instead of death. The Kindred helmet has no ability, but the reference is directly in the name.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Pokemon\n\n\n\nKat\nKat is a reference to the character Serena. The skin used for Kat is that of Serena from a later part of the Pokemon anime. Kat\u02bbs pet sitting is also a reference to the daycare mechanic from the Pokemon games. In the games, you could leave Pokemon at a daycare and they\u02bbd gradually gain experience. In skyblock, leaving pets at the pet sitter will level them up a rarity.\n\nPet Items\nPet items are a reference to the held item mechanic. Pokemon can hold certain items, one at a time, and receive different buffs or effects depending on the item. In skyblock, pet items can be held to give your pet different buffs or effects.\n\nCarrot Candy\nCarrot Candy a reference to rare candies. In the games, rare candies can be used to instantly level up a Pokemon. In skyblock, carrot candies can be used to give a pet instant exp.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Touhou\n\n\n\nStereo Pants\nThe Stereo Pants includes a reference to Touhou. One of the songs the Stereo Pants can play, Flowering Night, is Sakuya's battle theme from Touhou 9: Phantasmagoria of Flower View (yes I did directly copy paste from the wiki).\n\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nSpoiler: Anime\n\n\n\nTank - Castle of Stone\nThe Tank's Castle of Stone ability is a reference to Log Horizon's Castle of Stone ability. In Log Horizon, Castle of Stone is an ability used by the Guardian class and makes the user invulnerable and unmovable for 10s, but makes them unable to act. In skyblock, Castle of Stone makes the user invulnerable and unmovable for 5s, but they can still act. The aggro mechanic in skyblock's Castle of Stone could also be a reference to Log Horizon's Anchor Howl ability, which draws the attention of all nearby enemies and is seen used with Castle of Stone.\n\nScarf\nDuring the fight with Scarf in floor 2, he will occasionally say lines that are references to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Naruto. \"Yare yare daze\" is a JoJo reference (haha I said the funny line) and \"Necro no Jutsu!\" is a Naruto reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: YouTube\n\n\n\nSven\nThe Sven Packmaster is a reference to Pewdiepie's wolf, Sven, from his Minecraft survival series.\n\nPig's Foot/Frozen Chicken/Wolf Paw\nThese talismans are a reference to Technoblade. In the early days of Skyblock, Techno made a video about being the fastest man in skyblock. He went through the trouble of manually grinding a Bat Talisman, only to be greeted with a +1 speed buff. When the End Island released, a race was introduced that gave the Pig's Foot, a direct reference to Technoblade (cause pig). Since then, there have been more races, each giving talismans that only gave +1 speed. This was only changed in the release of the dungeon hub, where the race gave a talisman with +3 speed instead of +1 (big different, I know), though you do start off with a +1 speed talisman that you can upgrade.\n\nPotato Talisman/Basket of Hope from the Great Potato War/Potato War Silver Medal/Potato Crown\nThese items are references to the Potato War between Technoblade and im_a_squid_kid. The Potato War was a short YouTube series that consisted of the two YouTubers competing for the top spot in the potato collection. Eventually it was decided that the winner would be chosen by whoever reached 500mil potato collection first, that being Technoblade. The Potato Talisman was given to all players who logged in for some time after the war ended. The Basket of Hope was given to all those in the top 1000 potato collection. The Silver Medal was given to im_a_squid_kid. The Crown was given to Technoblade.\n\nThe Potato King\nThe Potato King NPC is a reference to the Potato War mentioned above. It was a temporary NPC that gave the Potato Talisman. Its skin was Technoblade holding a giant potato over his head, showing he was the winner of the war. Really I just wanted to separate it since it was an NPC and not an item, and the description was getting a bit long.\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\nSpoiler: Dr Seuss\n\n\n\nGrinch\nThe Grinch sea creature is a reference to the The Grinch That Stole Christmas! book by Dr Seuss. Like how the Grinch is known to steal presents, the sea creature is said to have stolen Jerry's gifts when you fish it out.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Greek Mythology\n\n\n\nWater Hydra\nThe Water Hydra is a reference to the Hydra. The Hydra was a serpentine-like monster. If you cut one head off, two more would grow back in its place. The Water Hydra works similarly in where dealing enough damage to it will cause it to split into two.\n\nKing Midas/Midas Sword/Midas Jewel\nThe King Midas mob and Midas items are a reference to the story of Midas. He is commonly known for his ability to turn all he touches to gold. The King Midas mob from floor 3 is a direct reference to King Midas, the Midas Sword's ability is based on the amount of money you pay, and the Midas Jewel grants the ability Bryon's Compassion, which gives a chance to give money upon killing an enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo name some in the replies if I forgot any.

Minigames will be scored With a 300 point system. The scores are: C 110 points or less.

Because there is no combat in this island Well there is a use for these items because in this island there is also a Colosseum where you can pvp/chill! And theres exclusive types of duels offered by a NPC that works like the one at the original colosseum. Theres 5 Duels.\n\n\nRegular 1v1 Duel. Nothing to say here\n5v5 Duel for more chaos! (You cannot hit teammates)\nAll abilities duels (1v1, 3v3 or 2v2v2) Magic Damage does work in here!\nBird Duels. (1v1 2v2 or 1v1v1v1) Regular Duels but Speed is set to 1000 And you can Fly (Damage Is Increased by 40%)\nNo Armor Duels. (1v1, 2v2 or 1v1v1v1) As the name says theres no armor allowed in this duel (You cannot deal over 95% of your oponnents hp in a single hit)\n\nIf youve been reading to this point you might be asking, What are the minigames? Here ill show the concept of all 4 minigames (Probably Going to be expanded till 12 minigames)\n\nIt is very important to know that minigames will not include anything that isnt provided in the minigame during the minigames (Everyone has the same things like in a bedwars game for example)\n\n1. Egg Battle \n\nYour placed in a 5 layered platform with up to 29 other players. Your speed is set at regular speed and your goal is to use eggs to throw people to the void. The platforms first layer will be 16x16 the 2nd layer will be 18x18 the 3rd layer will be 20x20 the 4th layer 22x22 and the 5th layer 24x24 (All of these will be shaped circularly) These layers have a 4 block vertical distance between each other,Your given a infinite egg supply. The eggs will also have knockback I to help you melee nearby enemies. You cannot die other than by falling off the void. There will be powerups which spawn every 20s (One powerup per layer. The powerup spawns in a random place of the layer) There is 3 powerups which are: \n\nPowerup NamePowerup UsageDurationTriple EggsThe powerup as its name says makes you shoot 3 eggs at once in a 20 degree spread8 SecondsDiggerYou are given a anvil which when placed will fall destroying any block in its way making a hole for players to fallIf the anvil isnt placed within 15s it will despawnRabbit LeapsYou gain Jump boost VII Which can be usefull to get to a higher layer if you have fallen down4 Seconds\n\nAfter the 2:00 mark TNT will start falling from the top destroying blocks where it falls (All of the platforms should be destroyed at around the 7:15-8:00 mark if no block had been destroyed other than by TNT) The tnt will also knockback any nearby player. Once the 3:00 time mark is reached All players take +25% knockback from ranged egg hits and the egg becomes enchanted with knockback II for melee. Once the 5:00 time mark is reached All players get Slowness I and eggs are thrown at +50% speed. Once the 6:30 time mark is reached All players take +175% Knockback from ranged egg hits and the egg becomes enechanted with knockback IV. If the 7:15 Time mark is reached Rabbit Leaps powerup is disabled and wont spawn. (Only Digger and Quintiple Eggs) Triple Eggs turn to quintiple eggs because Triple eggs will be shot by default now. [This game focuses on using knockback to defeat enemies]\n\nScoring Of the game: Every 10s Lasted Gain +1 Score. Every player who dies before you grants +6 Score. Winning Grants +30 Score, Winning before the 5th minute grants a extra +40 Score.\n\n2. Builder Birds\n\nYou are placed in a series of small islands competing with 29 other players to build the shown structure as fast as possible. There is 40 rounds in total, And you have a 8:00 Time limit. You win by either completing all the rounds or being the one completed most buil when the time runs out. The first 5 rounds will be in a 8x8 building area and itll be around 20-35 blocks. Rounds 6-10 will be in a 10x10 building area and the build will be around 30-40 blocks Including trickier blocks like slabs/stairs. Rounds 11-20 will be in a 14x14 building area with a around 50-80 blocks count including very tricky objects as buttons tripwire hooks levers pressure plates cobwebs and even string. Rounds 21-30 will be in a 16x16 building area with a very high 75-100 block count and very complex builds including any item you can think of. Rounds 31-35 will be in a 18x18 building area at 95-115 blocks each featuring builds which require great skill to build fast. And the final rounds 36-40 will be in a 20x20 building area at 120-150 blocks possibly including a full inventory of blocks needed. Between Each island there will be a gap which you will have to bridge trough (Your given infinite redstone blocks to pass) The gap is adding 2 blocks per round starting at 10 at round 1. But you must be carefull when bridging Not to let your redstone bridge touch the TNT that will be spread around in the air (Around 20-200 TNT per gap) or else your bridge will be destroyed and youd have to start remaking it. In these gaps you may also see gold blocks in the air (1-5 per gap 10 at last round) These are gotten by the same was as youd blow up TNT, These gold blocks dont do anything normally but incase theres a tie in rounds by the amount of gold blocks gotten the winner will be decided. [This game focuses on rapid building/speedbridging]\n\nScoring Of the game: Every build completed grants +6 score. Winning grants +60 Score.\n\n3. Pearl Race\n\nYour placed in a massive map where you race 29 other players to get as far as you can in the pearl race. You Cant move at all other than by ender pearls Your supplied infinite pearls (4s Cooldown) You have 8 minutes for the race. The race begins with easy hits like 4x4 platforms with a 3 block wall to avoid dying. After that you might start mainly seeing 2x2 or 3x1 platforms. There may even be places where you have to go trough a hole in the wall to get to your location. Later on paintings and 1x1 platforms will be the main thing. Once your getting closer to the end of the race your gonna see lots of random walls of iron bars 1x1 from floor-roof that your gonna have to avoid and probably your gonna have to land on single fences/cobblestone walls at the very ending parts its gonna be a really tight place featuring extremely hard to get locations. The whole path is about 1000 Blocks Taking 4 turns to the right all 4 of em or to the left all 4 of em (You know where im going dont you) Once you pass the ending part youll find yourself back at the beginning in a \"new lap\". There will be Checkpoints every 80 blocks or so that will be marked by a particle wall, youll spawn in the checkpoints if you have failed a epearl jump. Theres no ender-pearl damage in the minigame. The Winner is decided by who got furthest into the race. By either the furthest checkpoint in the lap that they got to. (Tiebreaker would be at what time did they reach the checkpoint which they ended on) or by the exact furthest block counting laps that they ever got to. (Tiebreaker (Very rarely) would be what time did they reach that block peak). [This game focuses on precision epearl throws and its a fun og minigame from 2013 too!]\n\nScoring Of the game: For every player beat you get +8 Score. Winning grants +60 Score.\n\n4. Battle Birds\n\nYour placed in a map of nearly the same style as TNT Tag with 29 other players. The goal is to be the last one alive. Your set at 110 speed. The map will give you 3os to get as high as you can (About 40 blocks from ground level should be the highest possible) Before a border starts slowly rising (Lava or whatever u want as long as it kills u) Which will completely cover the map in around the time mark of 7:00. Your given a Knockback I stick but you have a 2s cooldown per hit, You get a punch I bow with 4 arrow shots, Use it wisely as you wont get more shots ever. After the 4:00 mark Stick cooldown is entirely taken off and it gets Knockback III instead. Player speed is naturally 125 now but if your hit by a stick its at 25 for 1s. After the 6:00 mark staying in the same spot for 3s starts damaging you. 1 Heart a second (Only way to take dmg other than falling down) But you will never regenerate hp, You will also be forced to hit a player every 10s at least to avoid taking 1 heart a second dmg Once your at the 6:45 mark you get knockback VII on your sticks (basically to kill everyone) And if you dont hit within 2s you take 6 Hearts a second. Incase 2 players die at the same time they will be tiebreaked by the amount of hp they had before dying. [This game focuses to be some pvp/parkour mix type of minigame]\n\nScoring Of the game: For every player that dies before you, Gain +8 Score. Winning grants +66 Score.\n\nThis is all i got for now tell me what you think about it cuz this took me 4 hours to make :/"}, {"title": "[POLL] Was the mage nerf too harsh?", "body": "I think most of us agreed mage needed a nerf beforehand, but now some people are complaining that it was too far.

A melon farm may make more money at the beginning, but you lose out on a lot of perks. A melon farm only makes more money than a pumpkin farm if you use a silk touch axe to farm it, (I've been notified that it does give farming Exp, but I don't think that they have double drops from the farming skill). The farming skill gives the player a chance to get double or triple drops when farming, and also gives a good amount of base health which is hard to come by later in the game. At high farming levels, I think its at 37, pumpkins start to make more money than melons.\n\n2. Pumpkin collection is better than melon collection. Pumpkins can be used for a variety of things. In the collection, you can upgrade the minion for more slots (melon can also do this), but most importantly, pumpkin collection has the farmer's boots. These boots are extremely useful throughout the game. They give extra speed based on your farming level, 4 per level (also 2 health per farming level but that's meh). This can be used to farm pumpkins even faster with extra speed, and also used later game to farm slayers and zealots faster. Farmer's boots can also just be crafted and then sold on ah for more money than just selling the enchanted pumpkins would make. Pumpkin collection also has the farmer's orb which is just an uncommon talisman but talismans are always good so that's a plus.\n\nthank listen ted talk yes bye"}, {"title": "did anyone get a speical zelot and than got a speical zelot from that", "body": "I stole a enderchest zelot once and and got a special zelot"}, {"title": "How do I get more crit damage (read description)?", "body": "Ok so basically I have 100% crit chance and 395% crit damage (with potions).

Supercell alone is worth 5.5B. Some may say they make bank due to having a great game. The more cynical amongst us will say that they make bank by repeatedly nerfing/buffing in-game items, after you already spent months of your saved up \"free\" gradually acquired in-game money (such as minion revenue) on a particular item -- just for them to nerf the item later and make a different item better in its place. This, in turn, incentivizes microtransactions -- using your IRL money -- to upgrade the item that they unilaterally decided to make better without notice. We saw this happen in Skyblock recently with very expensive items (ie. Pigman). Poof, there goes 20M.\n\nThere is no such thing as a perfect \"balance.\" It is a Platonic ideal that exists only in the world of \"Forms.\" There will forever be imbalance, a \"meta,\" and complaints of OP gear etc. When you take this without the perverse incentives that come with MTX, you're in for being milked of $10 occassionally, to where you've given the developer $100 before you know it.\n\nWhen you combine (1) subpar testing and pre-release balancing due to snails-pace release of content and the need to get something new out, because you lack enough developers, with (2) the need for more developers, a need for more revenue, and an openness to selling in-game currency for IRL money, you get (3) an incentive to continually nerf/buff items without notice to prompt consumers to purchase in-game coins to catch up to the new meta, which (4) sends the economy into chaos and uncertainty.\n\nAs to the nuke, no one denies that something about the Mage class needed a nerf, but we've seen 100 different suggestions of what should have happened. To me, it is clear that the Mage class itself was not the issue. The problem was certain items. Pigman should not have been spammable with no cooldown with such a low mana cost. Conversely, it also should not have been rendered practically useless with a 5 second ability affect and 5 second cooldown. The Pigman should have been spammable for strategic use (such as for SA's, LA's, and AA's), but had a much higher mana cost.\n\nThis is the writing I'm seeing on the wall with Hypixel.

Some things in the changelog have not been added to the main body of text, a few spoilers are empty and the new features in v4 and v4.1 have not been balanced. This means that feedback or suggestions in the comments will really help.\n\nSo the floor in the obsidian sanctuary is mostly bedrock. That means that the only 7th level there could be would be the void.\n\nThe Void requires Mining Level 12 to enter. (There's also a mining 18 barrier between mid and endgame)\n\nThe void is accessed through a portal at the back of the obsidian sanctuary.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Floating Islands and Ores\n\n\n\nIn the void, there are lots of small floating chunks of land that spawn ores of all types with particle effects on them. These special ores drop more of their respective ore - as you get higher in The Void they drop more, the drops will be listed in the layers section. There are a few small nether islands that occasionally spawn quartz and glowstone, with the same particles and drops. The particles have different colours depending on how much of their ore they drop.\n\nThe ores will give you more mining XP the more they drop, but not scale up constantly (eg: 10 resources = 4X normal XP, 15 resources = 5X normal XP or something)\n\nSmelting touch and silk touch do not affect the enchanted drops, but they will affect the unenchanted drops.\n\nUnbreakable blocks will sometimes spawn between the islands to allow people to jump across, but they will change colour (to yellow, then orange, then red, for instance) when they are about to disappear.\n\n\n\nAlso, the slime hat only gives -50% knockback in The Void to stop people from becoming invincible, and the void doesn't have a lift as it is a separate area.\n\nThe Void is vertical - you spawn in at the bottom and as you go higher the mobs get stronger and the ores drop more materials.\nMobs will go below their layers if they are chasing an attacker, then fly back up if the attacker is killed.\n\nThe mobs in the void are blazes, ghasts and bats. Basically, any mob that can fly. (Except dragons, for obvious reasons.) Here are their stats and drops. Layer details are at the bottom because they're long.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Void Mobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Void Vampire (low-tier)\n\n\n\nVoid Vampire (bat)\n- The most common spawn.\n- Has (base layer health) health and deals (base layer damage) damage.\nDrops:\n- Guaranteed: Vampire Fang\n\nCrafting recipes:\nEnchanted Vampire Fang: normal enchanted recipe\n\n\nSpoiler: Bloodbox (and upgrades)\n\n\n\nBloodbox (or other, better name) (uncommon talisman): 64 of them in 8 stacks of 8 around the outside. When you kill a mob, the box gains 1 point for each level the mob had. You cannot have more than one of these active in your inventory. Once the Bloodbox has 1000 points, you can right click with it to heal all your health.\nBig Bloodbox (rare talisman): Bloodbox in the middle and a stack of Vampire Fangs in every other slot. The same but it only needs 800 points and you also regain all your mana.\nEXPANSIVE Bloodbox (epic): BB in the middle and 16 EVF in every other slot. The same but it only needs 500 points and regenerates all your health and mana and also gives you a +5% increase to all stats for 10 seconds.\nThese may need balancing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Blood Boost\n\n\n\nBlood Boost: Made with 144 EVFs (16 in each slot). Buffs the set bonus of a dragon set when applied to the helmet. For instance, the superior bonus becomes a 6-8% boost rather than 5%, the wise bonus will be +50% again after the nerf, the young set becomes +100 speed (probably at any health) etc.\n\n\n- Rare drop: Bite Fang - 2 stacks and a stick used to make the Bite Sword (Basically a silver fang with an extra 50 strength and an ability that turns you into a bat)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Void Ranger (mid-tier)\n\n\n\nVoid Ranger (blaze)\n- Not as common as the VV.\n- Has (base layer health x 3) health and deals ranged damage with fireballs. Damage is (base layer damage x 2)\n- Guaranteed: Ranger Rod\n\nCrafting recipes:\nEnchanted Ranger Rod (normal enchanted recipe)\n\n\nSpoiler: Ranger Weapon Set\n\n\n\nRanger baton (2 stacks of RRs and a stick) 150 damage.\nRanger bow (3 stacks of RRs and 3 string) 200 damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Ranger Ring (Talisman)\n\n\n\nRanger Ring (9 stacks of RRs) rare talisman, +5 damage when you do a ranged attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Void-Powered Set\n\n\n\nVoid-powered Boots (4 enchanted RRs in a boot recipe shape): Gives you +1 strength for every mining level until level 15. Level 16-20 give you 2 strength each, 21-25 give 3 each, 26-32 give 5 each, 33-40 give 8 each and 41-50 give 15 each because that's some serious dedication. For instance, if I have mining 20 I will get 1 strength each from levels 1-15 and 2 each from 16-20. I will get a bonus 25 strength along with the default armour stats, which are similar to farmer boots - 20hp, 40 defence and +10 strength.\nVoid-powered Pickaxe (3 ench RRs and 2 sticks): Diamond pickaxe, cannot be enchanted, has telekinesis and gets 1 level of efficiency for every 4 or 5 mining levels you have.\n\n\n\n- Uncommon drop (probably 20%): Fast Fuel\nCounts as fuel for a minion, but when placed in a minion it is instantly destroyed and the minion generates around a stack of resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Ghost of the Void (high tier)\n\n\n\nGhost of the Void (ghast)\n- Rarest of the three vanilla mobs.\n- Has (Base layer health x 10) health and deals ranged damage with fireballs. Damage is (Base layer damage x 5)\n- Guaranteed: Ball of Fire\n\nCrafting recipes:\n- Enchanted Ball of Fire (normal ench recipe)\n\n\nSpoiler: Fire Cannon\n\n\n\nFire Cannon (2 stacks of BoFs and an iron ingot in the shape of a sword recipe.) When you (right or left idk) click with it it launches a fireball at no mana cost. Your fireballs do not cause damage to blocks. (this should also apply to the ember rod to stop people destroying their chests)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Relic of Fire (Talisman)\n\n\n\nRelic of Fire (legendary talisman) made with 9 stacks of EBoF. You have to kill 92,160 of the rarest vanilla mob in the void to get this so I don't think it's overpowered. This talisman gives you small bonuses in most combat stats (more strength, crit damage and chance etc)\n\n\n\n- Very Rare Drop: Core of the Void (used to upgrade a few very, very rare items, some of which are secret and/or unreleased.)\n\n- Very, Very Rare Drop: Summoner of the Void (used to summon the Shadow of the Void)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Soul of the Void (very high tier)\n\n\n\nSoul of the Void (Custom Head with Particle Trail)\n- Rarest mob in The Void\n- Health and damage varies depending on which type of SotV it is\n- There are lots of different types of them and they have different stats and attacks, but they all fly and shoot homing wither skulls.\nTypes of Soul of the Void (and the colour they are):\n- Normal (white): Normal things and a melee rush attack, Layer health x20 and layer damage x10\n- Stealthy (blue): Has very few particles making it harder to see and gives you blindness when near, Layer health x10 and layer damage x10\n- Magic (magenta): Shoots lasers at you and makes fake copies of itself that look like they have the same stats but disappear when hit once. Layer health x16 and layer damage x8\n- Lightning (yellow): Randomly shoots lightning at you. Layer health x14 and layer damage x7\n- Toxic (green): Hits your slayer bosses and refuses to stop... no jk it does poison attacks. Layer health x18 and layer damage x8\n\nDrops: blablabla will add eventually\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Shadow Boss\n\n\n\nThe Void Boss: Shadow of the Void/The Shadow\n\n\nSpoiler: Boss Battle Basics\n\n\n\nUse 4 Summoners of the Void at the Summoning Stand in the middle the very top of the Void area. During the fight anyone who dies in the top area of the void will respawn a bit below where they were (1 layer down).\nThe Shadow of the Void/Shadow is a wither that launches explosive skulls repeatedly. They can be deflected like ghast fireballs but they are faster. (This is to add a bit more skill to bossfights.)\nDuring the fight, disappearing blocks will spawn more often, but still leave a majority of empty blocks.\nThe boss will probably have around 7.5mil-10mil hp.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Prizes and How to Get Them\n\n\n\nWhen killed, the rewards are calculated like this:\n100pts per summoner you placed.\n150pts for 1st, 100pts for 2nd, 75pts for 3rd, 50pts for 4th-5th, 30pts for 6th-10th, 10pts for participating.\nEveryone who participated gets a free Shadow Orb due to the 10 point minimum (reason explained later).\n\nPoint prizes:\n400pts: Shadow Launcher (Like the fire cannon, launches a projectile consisting of dark particles at no mana cost and with no cooldown or charging up time. Travels in a straight line from where it was fired and deals damage similar to an aotd but can be done at a range, however endermen are not affected as they teleport away before it hits them.)\n300pts: Shadow Chestplate\n250pts: Shadow Leggings\n200pts: Shadow Helmet\n150pts: Shadow Boots\n\n\nSpoiler: Calculation Explained\n\n\n\nI'll explain how this works. Let's say I get 375 points. I cannot get the shadow launcher as I did not get enough points. However, I have a chance to get the Shadow Chestplate. The chance is increased a fair bit because I have more points than needed.\nIf I get the chestplate, the calculation stops and I get the chestplate. 300pts are subtracted from my total and then the rest of my points are turned into Shadow Orbs at 10pts per orb. (This is why the 10pt minimum gets everyone a free shadow orb). I get 7 shadow orbs and the chestplate.\nIf, however, I do not get the chestplate, I am then moved to the next one down (in this case, leggings). The chance is increased more this time as I have even more points above the requirement. The same thing repeats.\nIf I do not get any of the prizes, then all my points are turned into Shadow Orbs, and you get an extra shadow orb for every prize you missed. I would get 41 shadow orbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Shadow Orb Recipes\n\n\n\nCan be crafted into Shadow Armour using 20 in each slot.\nCan be used to upgrade a catalyst to 10x resources.\nCan use 9 of them to create the Shadow Talisman (rare). It makes you take 10% less damage from the Shadow of the Void.\nCan use 8 of them to make the shadow bag (uncommon talisman). When in your inventory, it will sometimes generate an item. Usually it generates normal items (iron, wood etc) but sometimes it can generate rarer items (enchanted gold, jerry eggs etc) and it has a 7/13000 chance to generate a really good item like a Shadow Orb, a crystal fragment or a revenant flesh.\nYou can only use one shadow bag at a time, and the resources will have a chance to generate when you do something (eg: kill mobs, get collection XP). More combat/collection XP = higher chance.\nCan craft a piece of Shadow Armour with lots of shadow orbs to upgrade it. (see more in the Shadow Armour section)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Shadow Armor\n\n\n\nShadow armour stats are similar to superior dragon, if not then probably strong or unstable (maybe even wise) or a mix of them all.\nHelmet piece bonus: Dark Mind - If you sneak while attacking, you use 25 mana to deal extra damage.\nChestplate piece bonus: Dark Armour - 1.5x defence\nLeggings piece bonus: Dark Motion - +40 speed\nBoots piece bonus: Dark Descent - You take no fall damage.\n\nFull set bonus: Darkness of the Void\nShift and jump at the same time to use 50 mana to gain 10 seconds of flying forward in the direction you are facing. (You can change direction while flying). If you shift-jump while flying the 10 seconds is added to the end of it.

If you think of something I should add then tell me in a reply.\n\nTl;dr: 7th deep caverns level with ores that drop enchanted materials, very strong mobs and a boss that drops a new armour set, a weapon and a crafting material. It's vertical and has scaling mobs, drops and ores.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Basic Version (Tl;dr but longer)\n\n\n\nfiller text blablabla\n\n\n\n======================================================\n\n\nSpoiler: Changelog\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nSpoiler: v2\n\n\n\nShort version of the update: New boss name, tl;dr and armour upgrades.\n\nv2 - Added that the name of the boss could also be The Shadow, courtesy of @Scythe and added a tl;dr because @Onicalmc said it was too long. Also added that shadow orbs can be used to upgrade shadow armour.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: v3\n\n\n\nShort version of the update: Added the mining requirement, rebalanced some things, added an item or two.\n\nv3 - Added an estimate for the HP (@Jefficorn suggested this and the amount of HP).\nAdded a required mining level - @SnitchyPoo said level 15, @VeryStressed said level 20 and @SoshJam said level 22 or 25. I decided on level 18 as I'd say that's the last level that doesn't require grinding for ages.\n@YehuDash said that Fast Fuel should be based on the time taken to generate resources and I think that's a pretty good suggestion. I'm not going to make it more powerful as it is easy to get and designed for a small resource/collection boost. However, I will make it drop more often (from '5-20%' to 20%).\n@TheButterWaffle said that higher mining levels should be worth something, so I expanded on that and made the void-powered boots and pickaxe.\n@PanPanPanda534 said it was too easy to get lots of things, so I made the slime hat only give -50% knockback in The Void.\nI also added that the void has a lift, as it wasn't clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: v4 (massive update)\n\n\n\nv4 (MASSIVE OVERHAUL)\n\n\nSpoiler: v4.0 (Massive overhaul, but incomplete)\n\n\n\nI've been working on this update on and off for DAYS now. I timed my first editing session and it was at least an hour. I must've spent hours in total on this update alone, but this thing is so much better already.\nShort version of the update: Changed nearly everything. It's vertical, there's a new mob, there's tons of layers and new drops. Everything is organised using spoilers and IT ALSO NOW HAS MIDGAME CONTENT THAT GOES ALL THE WAY TO POST-SLAYER 4. There are a load of new items, which are compiled (among everything else) in the new Basic Version (below the tl;dr)\n\n- Put all the long parts in spoilers so they are easier to navigate, and also added more detail to some of the items because of this\n\n- Changed it to be accessed through a portal at the back end of the obsidian sanctuary. This will deal with 2 issues - the bottom of the obsidian sanctuary being at y=0 and miner armour will not be too strong, problems found by @TTimo79 and @VeryStressed respectively.\n\n- @TTimo79 also suggested that, since it'd be a different area with a portal to it, I could make it vertical. This gave me the idea to make people spawn at the bottom and work their way to the top, with better ores and harder (and more) mobs the higher you go. Ores have different colour particles based on how good they are, and start by giving you 10 each of the material, then go to 20, a stack, a stack and a chance to get the enchanted version, then the enchanted version, etc.\n\n- @LordofTears came up with the idea for 'souls of the void' which are flying custom heads with particle trails behind them. (They also said I should remove the other mobs but no because variety). They can do different things based on what type of SotV they are - most of them shoot homing wither skulls, some cast blindness spells or do melee rush attacks. They will be at/near the top of the area\n\n- Made ores drop less (at least in the lower areas)@bhophaqs suggested that I make it a stack rather than the enchanted version, although I build on this quite a lot in the overhaul.\n\n- For the ores that drop a stack, the higher-up ones have the enchanted version as a rare drop and for the enchanted ones made the ench block a rarer drop, similar to how it was before\n\n- @Grolltar suggested that I should find a reliable way to make mining the ores harder. I'll go into more detail about it: Basically, at the lower levels there are weaker mobs and ores drop less, and then it gets harder and better the higher you go, to the point of being post-slayer 4. Mining level requirement is changed from 18 to 12 but there is an invisible mining level 18 barrier around the start of the endgame ores and mobs. @Pix_Hexate said that I could change it to be any game stage and that also helped me to come up with this. (wow, @Pix_Hexate came up with a lot of ideas)\n\n- @Pix_Hexate said that the mobs didn't deal enough damage and the ores would be too OP. The ores are already fixed in this same edit, so the ghasts will instead deal 2x zealot damage and have 100k health by the time you reach the OP areas. The lower tier mobs also have more health in OP areas.\n\n- Cleared up that silk and smelting touch do not change the drop for the enchanted variant (they'll always be the normal enchanted version) but they will affect the regular ores (iron ore requires smelting touch etc). Question raised by @BlakeAlexT12345\n\n- Find a way to make it more mining-based, suggested by @tootiemarlin710. However, we ran out of ores so enchanted variants is the best I can do without resorting to just rehashing the whole 'random drops from shiny blocks' thing in the end\n\n- Specify that you can only use 1 shadow bag at a time (just something I forgot)\n\n- @Pix_Hexate also said that just letting the shadow bag randomly generate things would cause a massive AFK problem, so I've changed it to have a small chance to generate an item when you do things (eg getting combat xp, killing mobs, getting collection xp) and make the chance depend on how much you do (eg more combat xp = higher chance)\n\n- @Pix_Hexate (again?!) said that if mobs didn't go below their area people could stand just under the area and cheese them, so I've changed it so that they will normally stay in their area, but when someone is near they will go up to a certain amount below their area and when attacked they will follow the player regardless of where they are. If said player is killed the mob will fly back up to its area.\n\n- Some people like @anime12345_xdpvpyt got confused due to a few important words/phrases being hard to see/find (like thinking the boss was a dragon when it's actually a wither) so I made some important words bold.\n\n- I came up with a whole bunch of new items\n\n- Made it so that when you die in the Shadow boss battle you spawn a layer below it\n\n- The Void no longer has a lift for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: v4.1\n\n\n\nReducued the block drops from higher layers as they are actually more op than before, which isn't what I wanted. Also made all of the base layer stats bold.\nv4.1.1: Post-Endgame Layer had accidentally been split into 2 spoilers so I fixed it\nv4.1.2: The changelog was completely broken, with random spoilers splitting it into 2 parts. So I fixed it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: v4.2 (actually really big, completed v4)\n\n\n\nShort version of the update: insert words here.\nRemoved all the joke layers because they weren't funny.\n@MisterCheezeCake said that the mining 18 barrier should also have a mining barrier. They suggested 16, but imo 12 would be better so that people have a choice between the end and the void.\nAdded that the ores should give you more mining xp the more they drop, but not scale up constantly (eg: 10 resources = 4x normal xp, 15 resources = 5x normal xp or something)\nRemoved the line saying this idea is sort of the end 2.0 as it's moved on from that.\n\n\nSpoiler:  Things finished from the v4 update\n\n\n\n- The Basic Version\n- Smelting touch and silk touch clearup\n- 1 shadow bag at a time\n- Shadow bag based on you doing things\n- Important things in bold (had previously only been done outside the spoilers)\n- Upgraded Shadow Armour info\n\n\nAdded the following new items (all my ideas):\nwill add them soon gtg\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf nobody is credited for something it's because I came up with the idea\n\n\nIf you have any ideas for things I should add, post them in the comments and if it's good I'll add it and credit you."}, {"title": "Is adaptive better then t12 perfect and mask for tanking", "body": "."}, {"title": "Spirit sword bug? or no", "body": "i died in a dungeon while having a spirit sword in my echest, when i came out i noticed it was gone. assuming i dropped it i bought another and it happend again it disappeared when i died. in the lore it says it turns into a spirit item when you die so is it meant to disappear after you die or is it a bug????"}, {"title": "Best Minion Straight Up", "body": "No slayer minions.

Toxic Arrow Poison Going Into Quiver\n\u200bFor some reason, Hypixel decided that Toxic Arrow Poison would directly go into your quiver. I think this was just so you could use the arrow poison by putting it into your quiver. But why make it go directly into the quiver? When you get your Toxic Arrow Poison (which sometimes you don't because of the next reason) it goes directly into your quiver, which is so annoying because you need to go into your menu, which means you need to be out of combat, which is annoying because it always takes over the 3 seconds when a mob hits you (I think its because an enemy is agro-ing on you and the game counts that as in combat) and after that, you need to open your quiver, take the poison out, and finally put it into your backpack. In addition to this, most people would be shooting their bows to get rid of the spiders so they could get out of combat (if they weren't aware of their Toxic Arrow Poison or maybe trying to get out of combat to get the poison out of their quiver), but that consumes the poison which means -2k coins every time they shoot their bows, which sucks (because I'm a cheapskate that is the type of person that would take 3 hrs using enchanted melon to lvl up alchemy instead of spending 2x coins using 10 min and enchanted sugar cane to lvl up alchemy.) I know this can be solved by having a full quiver and using arrows from your inventory, or having inf quiver 10, but I know that many people including myself like a clean inventory and some of us may not have inf quiver 10 because we're broke and/or too lazy to put it on.\n\n2. Stealing Toxic Arrow Poison \n\nHypixel also made it so if someone hits your boss, not even getting the final hit, they can steal you Toxic Arrow Poison, which sucks because Toxic Arrow Poison is what allows you to do Tarantula Broodfathers with only losing a lesser amount of coins and not go broke before you get a Tarantula Talisman or a Digested Mosquito. If your poison gets stolen, sucks, you need to try to get it back by asking to get your poison back, which takes away time that you would be doing more Tarantulas and wastes a minute of your god pots. Also, there's a chance they could keep it to themselves and/or leave, so you just lost some coins to fund your slayers.\n\n3. AOTE Ability Not Working In Cobwebs\n\nA while back, they nerfed the AOTE ability so it couldn't go through walls. I think this was a fair nerf, but for some reason, the AOTE ability counts COBWEBS as a solid block, which makes spider slayer VERY ANNOYING. We all know being stuck in cobwebs Sucks and it takes AGES to get out. Before we could easily get out of them, but now if you land and are inside the middle of cobwebs or your head is stuck you can't get out with the AOTE ability and need to wait to get out. That's not all either. What if you're stuck in cobwebs and there's a tarantula beast, mutant, or boss under you? The Arachnid foe hits you from below while you can't hit it in the cobwebs. Then they kill you and you lose your pots and if it's your boss you lose 50k as well.\n\nIf you agree and want to sign this petition, reply with \"signed\" and recommend anything that should be added or changed.

Only to look at the stats of the set and realise how completely abysmal they are.\n\nThis is supposed to be the optimal set for Archers, the pinnacle in damage and the set that makes the turning point and... Its stats are barely different from Skeleton Soldier.

Mage is no longer the class that shreds everything\n- This nerf made mage comparable to every other class, before mages could just go HAM and shred everything in the room before you even blink\n\n2. The nerf brought a spice of challenge for runs\n- Like the previous point, mage used to be the main thing if you wanted to complete a floor as fast as humanly possible, but now it bring the good old strategy field of dungeons\n\n3. Mage is actually fun to play now\n- Lets imagine a scenario, me, you, A, B and C are going to do floor Z, we both are mage and the rest are random classes\nBefore it would be me and you shredding everything else while the rest just tanks Shadow Assassins and every other bologni the game sends us while we shred every other mob\n\nIt's the same argument with slayers, slayers are boring because its just left clicking stuff that isnt a threat to us, this nerf made it so dungeons are challenging if you dont strategize enough, you have to dodge Super Archers, Soulstealers, Dreadlords, ETC\n\nFloor 4 without this nerf would be just mages shredding the mobs and the bear, now everyone has to work together to survive in dungeons\n\n\nTL: DR\n\nThe nerf brought challenges, made the class fun, brought strategy and class diversity is more required than ever."}, {"title": "[IDEA] Revamped Netherrack Collection, A New Talisman, and More (65+ Positive Reactions)", "body": "I was looking at the collections in the game for which ones I could max out easily some time ago, and I stumbled across the netherrack collection.

This would be unlocked in sand collection 8, at 10,000 sand collected, and it\u2019s recipe would be a piece of hard glass with 4 enchanted coal, making an x shape on the crafting grid.\n\nI am happy to hear any criticisms, objections, or ideas that you can share and will be updating this chart whenever I need to.

Skyblock has certainly provided more playtime than any other game, and I'm not entirely sure that's a good thing. I recently decided to take an indefinite break from playing Skyblock, and maybe even quit entirely. I doubt any of you know who I am, but I wanted to share some of the reasons I decided to (maybe) quit.\n\nEpisode I: The RNG Menace\n\n\n\nSpoiler: RNG\n\n\n\nComplaining about RNG because you didn't get an owoflux after spending like 3 coins on Sven 4s is dumb, so I'm not going to do that. Instead, I want to talk about how much of the game is based on luck--in fact, I'd argue that there is actually no skill required to play Skyblock well. All you have to do to succeed is to 1) not be a total idiot and 2) get a phoenix pet on like your 20th lapis zombie kill. At the same time, the horror stories of people with 2 million wolf slayer exp without dropping an owoflux show that RNG is bad in basically both ways that it could possibly be.\n\n\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Nons\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Nons\n\n\n\nJust like RNG, saying that \"nons are bad/dumb\" is as overused on the forums as anything else, but I'm serious. I can't count how many times I've been trying to do a F3 run and a lapis user with 300 health joins. This made getting a good dungeon party take like 10 minutes, even if you set a class note, because people are blind. Same goes for advertising in lobbies. I don't know if randos can still hit Slayer bosses, because I haven't decided to inflict self-harm by doing those in a while\n\n\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Playerbase\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Forums and Toxicity\n\n\n\nI made a thread a while back explaining why Skyblock is inherently a pretty toxic place, but what I've seen recently, both from others and from myself, is beyond that. I, among others, was literally cursing out the developers of the game for making one class in one aspect of the game too weak. The actual outrage I've seen over nons being sad that they got scammed, or Thirtyvirus making a video showing off a moneymaking method someone showed him, or unfortunate patches, or anything for that matter, is completely unwarranted and makes no sense.\n\n\n\nEpisode IV: A New Grind\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Grinding\n\n\n\nBefore I get into this, I want to make one thing clear: grinding absolutely has a place in a game like Skyblock. Anyone who disagrees is likely just a salty non who's mad they don't have an ender dragon pet after like 4 hours of zealot farming. However, Skyblock has sacrificed any idea of a meritocracy, as success is not determined by understanding of the game or any other metric of skill, but rather how much time you're willing to sink into menial, easy, and repetitive tasks in order to to increase your stats. That's not a good system by any means, and actually punishes players who spend a healthy amount of time on the game. That's when I realized what Dungeons is. It's a marginally improved version of Slayer. Mindlessly killing mobs in order to unlock a boss fight, and then speedrunning that hundreds of times on end hoping for an incredibly rare drop. No matter how fun the original gameplay is, if you have to repeat it for hours and hours and hours on end, it will quickly become mind-numbingly boring. Slayer was fun for the few weeks after it released, and now we're here.\n\n\n\nEpisode 5: The Endgame Strikes Back\n\n\nSpoiler: The Endgame Playerbase\n\n\n\nThe developers are really only catering to the endgame playerbase, even if they're trying to help everyone equally. The community of the endgame is so overly dedicated that they can burn through any content you give them in only a few weeks, and so in an attempt to please everyone equally, you end up creating content that requires ridiculous sums of money and grinding to be good at, creating a barrier of entry to the endgame, where almost no matter how hard you work, the endgame is always getting further away.\n\n\n\nEpisode 6: I'm done with this bit and it's not really funny anymore also was it ever?\n\nDungeons, Pt. 1:\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Dungeons, Part 1\n\n\n\nDungeons was the most anticipated update in Skyblock, and for the first time in a really long time, I realized I was actually enjoying playing Skyblock. The addition of intelligence scaling and new magic items meant that Dungeon runs could be incredibly satisfying and enjoyable...to a point. Even before the release of Floor 4, Dungeons had begun to get dull, as my Catacombs progress slowed and I acquired all of the items I needed to. Then Floor 4 released, but more importantly, the classes changed.\n\n\n\nDungeons, Pt. 2:\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Dungeons, Part 1\n\n\n\nWell, here we are now. Floor 4 and Mage. Honestly, Mage runs of Floor 2 or 3 were the only thing I actually enjoyed in Skyblock. The admins decided that instead of buffing the classes that weren't enjoyable or interesting to play, they'd obliterate the one class that people actually liked. Then, at the exact same time, with half of the Dungeons community reeling because they just became useless with their 40 mil setup, they hit us with Floor 4. My damage was less than 20% of what it used to be, and now I had to butterfly click 12 cps in SKYBLOCK just to regen my mana at the same rate I used to. The admins clearly don't really know what they're doing, or the definition of the words they themselves used (glass cannon). So I quit.\n\n\n\nThe one and only thing I enjoyed in Skyblock was reverted to what the rest of the game looks like--a clicking simulator you'd find as an online flash game on the barely functional Chromebook of a 6th grader in 2014. Skyblock had so much potential as a gamemode, but destroyed itself with its overly complex updates and progression, training its community to be aimlessly toxic and sink thousands of hours into menial tasks."}, {"title": "`", "body": "hjhjhj"}, {"title": "Damage Problem (Dungeons)", "body": "So I have got a full adaptive set + adaptive blade and i only deal 100k damage as a berserk while my guild mate does 400k damage with the same set.

At this point, he switches to a high-damage bow and shoots the player while in the air, then repeats the process.

Im proposing a island that requires combat level 20 that is just for endgame money grinding this is just a thought so I don\u2019t know what it would me but it would me SUPER nice to have!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n\n\nSo I recently bought and make a WHOLE new mincraf acc to \n\n\nreplay sky block and I just now realized how much mid games SUCKS there\u2019s little to no content which makes sense cus most ppl are end game so they want to add on there but \n\n\n\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n\n\n\n\n\nAslo How To Make Skyblock Less Combat Oriented\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, mining I would say is the one that most needs an update, it is boring af, not useful at all (you get like 2 defense every lvl), the mining island sucks, there is not even a pet that buffs mining (silverfish is the only one), there is no pet that buffs mining minions, or drops, while all other skills had their own updates, even if it wasn't that big (fishing update, replenish, treecapitator), mining is just bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow talking about skyblock being a combat oriented game, yes it is, lets say you want to focus on only one skill, this skill \"end-game\" are all bad (growth armor is the best armor you can get by only foraging, while in combat you can get 90% of the sets in the game), even for the own skill, fishing is a great skill, I don't find it fun, but the way they did it was good, even tho it is combat oriented (sea creatures).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I think skyblock should have a part of the end game a good endgame for all skills, so for example while in combat we could get the items that deal most damage, in farming we could get the best items for speed, in mining we could get the best defensive items, foraging could give us items that increase wood drop by a lot and focus on hp, idk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest problem is that in the developer perspective, creating combat related stuff is way easier, on a player perspective, most players find it fun, so that is probrably why skyblock is combat oriented, it is way easier to great combat related stuff and most people find it fun."}, {"title": "Talisman Shop", "body": "Is there one already?

Will feature new mobs new collections new ores and other stuff. I would really appreciate it if you support me", "body": "Hey Thank you that you clicked on my sugestion!\n\nWhat is The abandoned moonbase for place?\n\nThe abandoned moonbase is a new place for players to explore. Since the humans left the base it became abandoned and destroyed. the human were doing research about life on the moon. they brought some bacteria with them they could survive without the need of any oxygen. but after the human left the moonbase the bacteria started to evolve now they are more like creepy small animals. they have deystroyed parts of the moonbase. those creepy things are everywhere and will be able to get killed by you! since the windows of the moonbase are deystroyed there is no more oxygen. there will be an NPC that will give you an free oxygentank that will last for 4 minutes you can refill it by the oxygen generator next to the NPC. If your tank is empty you will start to take damage.\n\nHow to get the abandoned moonbase?\n\nOn the hub island there will be an launchsite. if you step into the rocket you will teleport to an moonlander. this moonlander is the only place where you can breathe on the planet. Inside the moonlander is the NPC who will give you a full oxygen tank. if you walk further outside there will be the oxygen generator. Now you can explore the moon and the abandoned moonbase!\n(you need mining 15 and combat 15 to enter)\n\nWhat new stuff are we able to get?\n\nThere will be new collections and rare drops available. Players can explore them through out the moon/moonbase.\nMobs:\n\nMutated bacteria\nThe people brought them here, but left them behind... something weird happened to them!\nThey became mutated and are very big. If you kill one it will split up into 2 if you kill those 2 bacteria, they will also split up. if you kill 1 you have to kill the splitted of the splitted to get drops\nThey will drop bacteria which will be a new collection. I'm still working on the collections and rare drops.\n\nThe Crawler\nThe crawler will be a new mob on the moon which lives in holes. this mob is not hostile but you can kill them for loot.\nYou can find them in holes on the moon. you can't go in the holes so you have to wait untill they stick out their head and slay them. If you dont have telekinesis you have a hard time collecting their loot because they will fall into the hole and you cant get them.\nThey will drop drills that will have a new collection. Wait Drills? Yes drills, they have drills to move underground.\nthey will have some new rare drops as well.\n\nBonkoscor\nThis terrifying monster is the reason that the humans left the base. This mob is a great predator and if it will spot you it will charge you. if you get hit by this charge you will take the half of your health as damage ignoring your defense. but you can easily evade this charge so keep watching in each direction.\nThis mob is the main reason why the moonbase is deystroyed.\nThey will drop a charged heart which will also be an collection.\nthe same here it will have rare drops as well\n\nThis are all the mobs maybe there will be added some new ones later.\n\nWhat does the moonbase look like?\n\nThe moonbase had 5 different parts.\nThis are all the parts:\n\nThe greenhouse\n\nPlants need water oxygen and sunlight to grow. right...?\nHere is an sentence of a diary of one of the human who where here.\nwe brought plants to look if we can create forest and other stuff on the moon. we found one plant that looked like he could survive the moon. Its is very strange because it needs no water and no oxygen...\nThere will be an new NPC that will sell tools to harvest this plant. In the new collection of this plant is also an minion but how will it grow this plant on earth or is there something else...\n\nThe living quartes\n\nSleeping with a view on earth...\nThis is were the Crew of the base sleep, eat, have fun and take a bath. In the sleeproom there is a dome where you can look up to look at the earth. The kitchen is the place where you talk to other people and have a delicious food. The bathrooms is to clean up. and there is also an arcade room for the lazy people with a break...\nAs a player you will be able to explore all the rooms and find diary's and read the story of the people. in your skyblock menu in the collection tab there will be an tab where you store all your story are. You can acces these storys everywhere!\n\nThe lab\n\nIn the lab the bacteria infested. you can find other story's from the scientist's. but be careful when reading because you can be biten in your back by an mutated bacteria. you can learn what all scientist's where doing with test and the bacteria they brought. you can even learn why the bacteria mutated.\nThe story will also be in the Story collection.\n\nThe transpory bay\n\nThis is were the human have their machines. The machines were a very important part of the base. In the transport bay there were machines that gathered materials for the people so that they dont have to go out themselves. there is also an place where the weekly food suplies came in. \nIn the moonsteel collection is an recipe that's called the moon explorer. This is the place where you can place them they will gather the materials for you.\nHere there will be an NPC called the Moon-miner. further information in the NPC tab.\n\nThe launchplatform\n\nOnce an crew member is getting homesick he can escape with the rockets that are parked here. this is also place where you can left the place. for a fun extra i thought it would be funny if that you wOnceill fall on to your spawnlocation on your island. This place has further no use.\nit looks nice or something... idk\n\nWhat new ores will we be able to find here?\n\nHere is a list:\n\nMoonstone\nvery common material you find this almost everywhere.\n\nMoonsteel\nRare rough material. you will need an Moon furnace to smelt.\n\nLindzen\nThis is also a rare material this is needed for the Moon furnace to smelt stuff.\n\nHasgar\nVery rare material But very powerful. Need a Shaper to make it a finer use able material.\n\nCrystal Core\nIt is not a hard to find material but it is protected by multiple Bonkoscor. You will need an Power extractor to extracts it power.\n\nBlitzor\nRare material you will need this for your Power generator.\n\n(maybe later i will add more i will just edit it in this thread)\n\nMoon explorers\nthis is an interesting new feature. Let me explain what moon explorers are. Moonexplorers will be in every ore/stone collection from the moon. You can craft them. im not sure what the recipe will be or what you will need to craft will be. You will be able to use them in the Transport bay. Once u are there there will be an control pannel. Here you can see the power of your moon explorers, The level, Which ore and the inventory. Because the moonexplorers will go out and mine moon ores for you. this depends on which ore you have place them. you have 2 slots for moon explorer (this can go up if i add more ores) the speed depends on how rare the ore is and its level. The storage of the explorers are basicly unlimited. But the power of the moonexplorers is limited. once the power is empty it will will return. and you have to charge it. so its not that if you are 28 hours away it will be collecting all 28 hours. You can charge them by taking an charger which is full of energy and put it in the moon explorer if its empty go to your Power generator and fill it.\n\nMachinery\nThere will be some new machine that you can place on your Personal moon.\n\nPower generator\nthis will provides power for the all of your machines. it needs Blitzor to run.\n\nCables\nthis will go from the power generator to the other machines to deliver power.\n\nMoon furnace\nCan smelt ores. Wait smelt ores? lol just use a furnace. no not really moon ores cant be smelted in normal furnaces. You will need Lindzen as fuel.\n\nPower extractor\nThis used to extract the power out of Crystal Core fragments it only uses power to work no fuel needed. The pure power out of the crystal is very usefull for creating weapons/armor.\n\nOxygen generator\nThis will provide oxygen on your Personal moon.\n\nPersonal moon\nThis is a new feature that i personally like the most. A personal moon is an expansion of your personal island not really an expansion but u can access it once you reached Moonstone collection VIII on your personal moon you will be able to build the machinery from above. you will be able to build everything you want on the personal moon. my idea was that is is looking like a small moon. also if you want the moonplant minion you can place that here. It is much smaller than your island but still enough space to fit several things in it. But there is one problem this is also a moon which means no oxygen luckily there is the machine from above the oxygen generator. If you placed this down you will be able to breath everywhere on the personal moon.\n\nSupport\nThanks for reading this far!

I would like to argue my case and hopefully get this resolved. The mod I was using was \"Schematica\" which is a mod that allows you to preview builds as a blueprint so you copy structures easily across worlds or servers. It also has a \"printer\" function that lets you place blocks automatically which greatly decreases the time it takes to build the schematic.\n\nWhether or not the mod is allowed clearly falls under Rule 2: Cheating and Exploiting. I don't think anyone would feel disrespected (#1) if someone used Schematica Mod; following \"sensible creative and artistic content\" (#3) is a whole different issue than whether or not the mod is allowed (what you build and how you build it are two different things); and unless Schematica Mod is a virus it won't jeopardize player and account safety (#4).\n\nSo what criteria does Hypixel have for saying something is an unfair advantage? Well, according to the rules, it must be at least one of the following:\n\n- encouraging cheating\n- an exploit\n- an autoclick / macro\n- an incident of cross teaming in solo games\n- an incident of team griefing\n- a disallowed mod\n- an incident of stats boosting\n\nSchematica Itself\nAccording to the rules page, the reason Hypixel has a rule against cheating and exploiting is:\n\n\n\n\"To provide a positive in-game experience for all players and is to ensure that hacks, cheats, macros and other behaviors are not used to gain an unfair advantage.\"\n\nClick to expand...\n\nThe last part of this could be taken two ways. #1: it could mean that hacks, cheats and macros and other behaviors are not used specifically to gain an unfair advantage. If this is true, then Schematica would seem allowed, because even if it is assumed to be a hack, cheat, macro or other behavior, it would not be used specifically to gain an unfair advantage (it would be used to build a house on your Skyblock island). #2: it could mean that hacks, cheats and macros and other behaviors are not used at all (with \"to gain an unfair advantage\" being implied). If this is true, then we have to prove that Schematica is not a \"disallowed behavior\".\n\nAccording to the section entitled \"What Mods are allowed?\", aesthetic modifications are allowed. Is Schematica an aesthetic modification? Well, the \"Guide to Allowed Modifications\" says that an aesthetic modification is one that:\n\n- changes only the look and feel of the game\n- does NOT modify gameplay\n- does NOT change the properties of blocks\n- does NOT change the player's perspective\n\nSchematica ticks all of these boxes.\n\nAdditionally, several Youtube rank players have used Schematica in videos and not gotten banned (even though those videos reached 3M+ views).\n\nThe case for \"use at your own risk\"\n\nIt's a bit of a loose cannon when it comes to mods. With Optifine, 5zig, etc., Hypixel can be pretty sure that someone isn't hacking. Although it may not be a disallowed mod as of itself, it could be used for disallowed things. Also, the people who want to use it for an allowed purpose may be confused about what constitutes an unfair advantage.\n\nFor instance, does using Schematica to build a gigantic AFK cactus farm constitute an unfair advantage because you could see where to place the blocks faster, thereby speeding up the building process and being unfair to players who play on vanilla? It's a grey area. However, does using Schematica to build a small house constitute an unfair advantage? Likely not. So where does it become disallowed?\n\nHypixel's guide to allowed modifications has a rule of thumb about this:\n\n\n\n\"a general rule of thumb is that any modification which provides any significant advantage to the players using them will be against our rules\"\n\nClick to expand...\n\nSo what is a \"significant\" advantage? There doesn't seem to be a one-size-fits-all answer. The described modification categories were listed above on the page; Schematica most clearly fits into \"aesthetic modifications\". Therefor it should not be punishable as outlined in the Hypixel rules."}, {"title": "test", "body": "test"}, {"title": "no", "body": "no"}, {"title": "Who else just collects minions and does something else or logs off", "body": "Who just collects the money from your minion and logs off?

This is an entry for a forum post update contest. This is not real. I am not an admin. Also, please DO NOT steal my ideas.\n\nA new update has been released! Here are the main topics:\n\nNew \u2018Quest\u2019 Mechanic\nA Small Fishing Update\nA new skill, Cooking\nSome minor bugfixes and additions\n\nQUESTS\nA new mechanic, introducing mostly minor tasks players may complete to gain recipes and bonuses to new items.\n\nQuests will range from easy to hard. Mid-late game players should be able to complete most of them, given much time. A few quests will require larger sums of money or skill.\nSome are extensive, multi-stepped quests, sometimes involving new NPCs.\n\nFISHING\nA major change to fishing, in hopes of making it slightly less boring. In the end though, it\u2019s still fishing, and is still a long grind.\n\nFishing exp will be increased 20%.\nDecreased fishing time by 15%.\nA few new mobs will be added, including mobs that require more skill to properly handle.\nA new weapon to fight against fishing mobs.\nA fancy new rod.\nA new \u2018friendly mob\u2019 mechanic, that give small temporary boosts to fishing. These Friendly Mobs circle around your head like pets. Their abilities stack.\n\nCOOKING\nHere\u2019s yet another new skill! This one is in the style of alchemy, but hopefully more interesting and less of a \u2018spend millions for useless ingredients to get lvl 50\u2019.\n\nIntroduces Foods, which can be consumed for various stat boosts.\nIntroduces a cooking table. Works the same as a crafting table, but for crafting Foods.\nRecipes for Foods will be placed all over collections, and a few in other places. Some recipes do not need to be unlocked.\nCooking will give roughly 10 pet luck and magic find at level 50.\nA few items have been changed to \u2018Food Items\u2019, such as golden apples, and regular apples, and potatoes, as they are edible. Items like pet food and enchanted cake are NOT Food Items.\nOnly 5 Foods can be consumed every 10 min, each taking up an imaginary 'slot'. Each food a player eats starts the timer for that \u2018slot\u2019, so you can stagger your use of the 5 Foods effectively if you so choose.\n\nQoL\n\nAdded an upgrade to the Maddox Batphone, removing its cooldown and making the slayer starting price cheaper by 5%.\nAH and BIN confirmation screen has been added. This can be disabled.\nAn unlockable Rune Bag, in the ender pearl collection.\nFixed Dungeon queue problems. \nRemoved the Dragon Claw from being dropped by Superior Dragons.\nThank you for taking the time to read! The full patch details will be released shortly, and a link to that post will be put here when it releases.\n\n\nPlease leave your opinion on these changes, and we will listen and take in any criticism with care."}, {"title": "why devs just why", "body": "why tf did you make the obi defenders attack"}, {"title": "How to turn on the bank API?", "body": "I know it's a dum dum question, but I can't find it in my settings.

This one is real tho.\n\nCOST OF DRAGON ARMORS (cheapest - expensive):\nOld: ~624K\nProtector: ~748K\nUnstable: ~811K\nHoly: ~1.2mil\nYoung: ~2.3mil\nWise: ~2.6mil\nStrong: ~3.8mil\nSuperior: ~64.59mil\n\nThis was tested on the first of August in 2020 at 9:45-9:53am. Lets see to how these sets stack up against each other.\n\n8 - Young Dragon Armor\nI do still think this dragon armor is the worst, with sub-par cost and multiple sets which are better than it (without another set, you can only go @~250% speed, not including pets). The benefits are that you don't have to get arthritis from clicking the Rouge Sword, and if paired with Crystal Armor, you can get 500% speed, but you still have to buy crystal for that to work.\n\n7 - Holy Dragon Armor\nThis isn't a Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. Holy Dragon Armor is here because it costs more than Old and Protector, and the Natural Regen is a bad perk when compared to any other dragon armor.\n\n6 - Superior Dragon Armor\nThis set costs alot, and for good reason, and that is because superior can do pretty much anything that other sets can, like it can be a tank, mage, berzerker, healer, and archer, which are all of the classes in dungeons! The downside is that you can get any other dragon armor and focus one class to become better than Superior. The only exception I could see is if you used Strong instead of Superior, you would have less Defence and CD/CC for a berzerker, which are all important.\n\n5 - Wise Dragon Armor\nEven though I think this set is good, especially considering it has the same Effective Mana as Crystal and its less time to regen, but what do I know. The set costs 2.6 million, and the majority of you say its bad, so I'm gonnaput it above superior because it has a reasonable cost. and also to make you five 12 year olds rage uwu\n\n4 - Strong Dragon Armor\nThe fact is that Strong costs almost 4 million coins, and Unstable is still a good budget option for those who don't need that. Before the reforge patch, I also found that a user who reforged both pieces to godly was dealing 31K with strong and 26k with Unstable, and even though that is a 5K damage increase, I can't put unstable below strong, as it costs 4x less... ok I just used a calculator and this is wrong its actually 4.6x.\n\n3 - Protector Dragon Armor\nThese last sets don't even cost a million, and i'm sorry for those who think this is a bait. Protector is a good budget Tank set, and the best out of the Dragon armors, but its only a slight advantage, so I have to give #2 to\n\n2 - Old Dragon Armor\nThis set costs 100K less and has the potential to have almost equal EHP to Protector, so I give it #2.\n\n1 - Unstable Dragon Armor\nThis set is still just ~5k damage away from being Strong Armor, its cheap, it allows you to switch off of that CC reforge, and it even gives you 25 mana for sticky situations. This set is great for its cost, b/c it doesn't cost a million due to the lost adventurers, and the set was always considered to be an option for damage in every meta, and that is why it is #1. Btw if you read the poll right it says COST the least, not which one is the BEST.\n\nEDITS:\nYoung Dragon Armor is now above Superior Armor.\nWise Dragon Armor is Now Above Protector\nStrong is now above Protector\n8 - Holy\n7 - Superior\n6 - Young\n5 - Protector\n4 -Old\n3- Strong\n2 - Wise\n1 - Unstable\n\nOpinion Update\n\nNEW LIST BASED OFF OF EVERYONES OPINIONS:\n8. Holy Dragon Armor\nSee first post. Click on the 1.\n\n7. Old Dragon Armor\nNobody cares about old dragon armor. BOOMER COST TOO LITTLE!\n\n6. Protector Dragon Armor\nNobody cares about Protector Dragon armor. NORMIE COSTS TOO LITTLE!\n\nThat was the terrible and bad, TL;DR somehow nobody cares about tank sets.\n\n5. Unstable\nApparently a damage dealing set for 800K is something no one cares about, but damage is still good\n\n4. Young\nYou get 500% speed if you love to spend money on god pots because everyone decides that God Pots are included on this list now so why the **** not.\n\n3. Strong\nYou get good damage with Tara.\n\n2. Superior\nWTF THIS SET COSTS 64 MILLION COINS AND MOST OTHER SETS OUTSHINE IT IN ONE ASPECT WHY IS THIS HERE.

(70+ positive reactions!)", "body": "This thread will be a megathread containing all of my ideas, and other peoples ideas as to how to fix and improve skyblock progression and balancing.\nIt is currently fairly small but will be expanded later.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the first part of my rant, as seen in a post yesterday that I put out.\n\n\n\nHere's the entire post:\n\n\nSpoiler: Entire text\n\n\n\nLet's start by talking about a new players experience. One of the first things most players would do in skyblock, is explore the area to understand where to find resources and NPCs. Normally after exploring a few zones, early game players would now focus on completing quests to help them better understand the game and game mechanics.\nOn the second day of playing, the player has probably leveled their skills to visit different islands. Within a few days of this, they are most likely combat 12 and can visit the end, even though they have little to no gear. The player will most likely grind for money to buy hardened diamond or Ender Armor, as they are good early game. At this point, the excitement of exploration and discovery is all gone, with the rest of the game consisting of grinding for better gear constantly.\n\nLet's talk about money. In order to buy a full set of hardened diamond armor, you need approximately 20k(estimate)\nThat's pretty cheap, and not extremely hard to get for most players.\nBUT, you need Diamond Collection 7.\nIn traditional game design, most items with level requirements are normally balanced so that you can quickly reach that level after you obtain the item. This provides positive feedback to the player, as they feel like they have accomplished a significant task by unlocking usage of a powerful item/armor set.\nHowever, in skyblock, a player can get the materials/coins to obtain hardened diamond armor in less than a few minutes if you are experienced, and have it take hours, if not days to unlock the recipe to even be able to craft that item.\nwhen skyblock was released, most items were worth much more, so this collection requirement made more sense, as diamonds were worth more and there was no bazaar to buy them from.\n\nAlso, let's talk about armour progression. Skyblock has so much potential with armor progression, but in the end it didn't work out well. There's TONS of early game armor sets that aren't even touched by the majority of players. To name a few: Mushroom armor, cactus armor, golem armor, and the list goes on.\nIn traditional games, and in game design practice, armor progression is normally pretty straightforward. The player chooses the stats/attributes they want to specialize in, and gets their first armor set. Using that set, they are now able to fight more creatures and explore more, where they can then unlock a new set, to fight/explore more, and the cycle repeats, creating a feedback loop for the player that makes them feel like they are doing a good job progressing. This system also makes it so players can learn what modifiers/enchants work best on items over time organically, making for more enjoyment as the player believes they are smart for figuring out proper ways to enchant and modify certain gear.\nSkyblock, however, does not follow this progression like AT ALL. Users can't craft their own gear because collection requirements are absurd for some items compared to their costs, and most of the time when early game players enchant their gear incorrectly, they are punished heavily for it as in skyblock players can be in the same armor set for months. Also, the majority of players never touch armor sets like mushroom armor, magma, leaflet, or cactus due to them either requiring too high of a collection level or not being worth the cost.\n\nThis game design makes it so that players do not receive the positive feedback of organically learning good practices for enchanting and modifying, either have to trade/buy gear instead of exploring and adventuring for it. This therefore makes mistake progression non personal to each player, as they aren't forced to discover, experiment, nor are they rewarded for crafting and obtaining items by themselves.\n\nIn fact, let's talk about dragon armour. Now, this was a GREAT IDEA! Like seriously, this is good game design! At this point in the game, players are allowed to experiment and find the players that fits with them, and with the side variety of decisions in armor, players are encouraged to experiment with different abilities, therefore organically making the player feel smarter when they finally find an armor set that is good for what they want it to be.\n\nBut, when we tie this in with progression, things get a little bit weird... An active skyblock could get dragon armor in two weeks of they are actively grinding, meaning they can have access to some of the best overall armor in the game very wuickly.\nWAIT, WHAT? TWO WEEKS of playing, and the player has access to an armor set that is one of the best overall, and the worst part is, they won't have to change armor sets for months... This is just straight up broken. The idea of dragon armor is great, and it's a good practice in game design to add specialties and sacrifices to items, which is exactly what dragon armor does. However, with the introduction of superior dragon armor, there is a \"best\" armor set. There being a best overall armor set isn't a good practice, in any games, as it discourages players from trying out different items and combinations.\nObtaining dragon armour is pretty weird too... You have to spend 5 million coins(A LOT of money for early-midgame players) on 8 summoning eyes, to spawn a dragon that has a random chance of being each type of dragon. If you aren't lucky, you will get a dragon armor peice, which can sell for 100k-1mil. That means you just lost 4-4.9mil from a dragon fight. That's bad. Dragon fights are supposed to be fun, and an achievement in your skyblock journey, but it's not worth the cost to do them at all.\nThis results in players then buying dragon armor from the auction house instead of doing exciting dragon fights to obtain the armor themselves. This is bad game design. Although getting your first set of dragon armor still feel good, wouldn't it feel so much better to summon and slay dragons to obtain it yourself, then retire and enchant it to your liking?\n\nI suggest that to change this, add different drops from zealots to combine into summoning eyes. They would be more common, and you would need 9 of them to craft a summoning eye. This would create positive feedback for summoning eye grinding, as even if the player doesn't get a summoning eye, they won't lot off empty-handed. Summoning eyes being more common would mean more dragon armor would be out into circulation, making it cheaper. I also suggest that super rare drops from dragons should be less RNG based, and more based on how much damage the players do, requiring over 8mil damage to get any of them. This gives players another fun money making method, along with improving zealot grinding feedback and modifying the market for ranged weapons as they would be needed more for dragon fights. This would also add another step in progression, and more fun experiences for midgame players.\n\nI'm not going to cover fishing and players in this post, because they are just too much of a mess imo.\n\nNow let's talk about dungeons. Being a fairly experienced skyblock player, I can say from experience that dungeons is SUPER FUN. And everything in-dungeons is amazing as far as game design goes,as it introduces good feedback, fun puzzles, and intense battles.\nI think the real problem here is how the classes are balanced. Now, don't get me wrong, the ideas and abilities for the classes are amazing, but they need some balancing. Intelligence scaling should get exponentially less powerful the higher your Intel gets, to need mage builds a bit. Abilities should cost more mana to discourage mindless damming and encourage strategy and quick thinking. Archer should have damage and abilities buffed, and ranges attacks on other classes(except for mage) should be significantly needed to introduce a need for archers in dungeon groups.\n\nProgression for dungeons should begin very soon after a new player gets their first few armor sets/tools, to give the player more flexibility and overall improve experience and decision making. Armor sets should have things they are clearly built for, and things they are bad at, to encourage creativity in mixing and matching armor peices. This would also encourage players to begin thinking about which dungeons class to pick early-game. There should be more in-depth quests to teach players how to enchant and reforge properly, in an organic matter. collections should be changed to account for the growing economy and standard armor sets, and level requirements should be modified to ROT game standards. Skills should have more rewards than just stay increases to encourage grinding. Last of all, RNG drops and grinds should be refined to ensure maximum player feedback and enjoyment, as nobody wants to spend 2 hours grinding without a summoning eye and dragon fights need a purpose.\nThis would also open up the server for much more YouTube content, as tutorials would become less effective and there would be many new gear combination possibilities to try out and showcase. Dungeons would be more fun and balanced, and the enjoyment that you had as an early game player discovering stuff for yourself would be brought back.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd here's problems, and solutions formatted:\n\nProblem: Armor progression is broken, as players normally never use the majority of armor sets.\nSolution: Skyblock should follow traditional game design practice for RPG and MMO games, by making collection requirements and combat requirements line up properly, so the player unlocks items around the time they would have enough materials to make them. This creates positive feedback for the player, and will greatly fix earlygame-midgame progression. There should be more in-depth quests designed to introduce new players to the concept of reforging and enchanting. Skyblock should be structured like RPG game armor progression, so new players gain their first armor set, and use it to fight new monsters, to unlock new armor sets, to fight more monsters and gather more resources, and the cycle should go on. This is common practice in RPG/Open World/MMO games as it allows players to figure out which playstyle they enjoy, and if they mess up enchanting/reforging armor, they won't be stuck in wrongly-enchanted armor for very long.\n\nProblem: Island progression and exploration isn't optimal for the game style\nSolution: Currently, the sense of mystery and exploration a new skyblock player has doesn't normally last for more than a few hours. Islands should be changed so that that sense of mystery is preserved. There should be more earlygame monsters to grind. For example, zombies in the graveyard should have different variants(more than just the zombie and zombie villager) that have higher chances to drop different loot. When a player first starts a profile and kills some of these monsters, they should have a high chance to drop an earlygame weapon or two, but as the player kills more the chance should decrease(giving the player a weapon or two to play around with, but not cluttering endgame player's inventories with useless items) The wilderness should have more than just DA, Tia, and the fairy pond(and a merchant). It should have monsters/wildlife. For example, rabbits could have a chance to spawn in the overgrowth, and remove them spawning in the mushroom desert. More dangers should be introduced around areas like the deep caverns, blazing fortress, and high levels to scare newer players and make them feel like there is more to explore. Skyblock's map is extremely small, and once you have been playing for a few weeks you will most likely know every corner of the map and everything about it. This is terrible game design, as once the environment is no longer interesting for players, the sense of discovery and positive feedback from it is gone. More dangers and obstacles should be introduced to make the map seem larger, and make it so that by the time earlygame players can access the dragons nest and areas like it, they will stand a chance against the mobs to give them a sense of achievement.\n\nProblem: Dragon Armor is ridiculously overpowered for how early you can get it in the game, and it's not worth it to fight dragons yourself to get the dragon armor.\nSolution: Most players can get dragon armor within 2-4 weeks of playing, and will most likely stay in that dragon armor for a few weeks to even a few months. Armor progression up to this point has been very enjoyable, as you are able to fight for your own gear, and discover methods of refining and enchanting gear. At this point in the game, players are forced to abandon early-game ways of obtaining gear, and rely purely on the auction house and buying items from other players. This is a big no-no in game design for all types of games, as even though having players rely on eachother for gear is important, it should be introduced much later into a players playthrough. Ordinary players normally resort to grinding summoning eyes to get enough money to buy dragon armor, which can be extremely frustrating. At this point in the game, players normally begin to grow frustrated if they can't get summoning eyes quickly. Once they obtain enough summoning eyes, they would sell to bazaar for money to buy dragon armor. When the player buys all of their dragon armor, they are most likely not going to feel very satisfied with themselves compared to when they were discovering everything for themselves, and fighting for their gear. Instead of using the summoning eyes they got, to summon dragons and have a ton of fun slaying them and getting gear by themselves, they resort to selling them to buy armor. This is terrible game design. Average players normally never get to experience the fun of summoning dragons, and would most likely be more satisfied if they earned the gear by themselves. In order to make dragons accessible for players so that they can grind for their own gear, summoning eyes would have to decrease in price. Currently, zealot grinding is already very frustrating and boring, as players can log off of hypixel with nothing to show for hours of grinding. To fix this frustration and negative feedback of not obtaining anything after grinding zealots for a long time, I suggest that summoning eyes should become rarer, and a new item should be introduced named a \"Summoning Eye Fragment\" or something of the sort. You would need 9 of these to craft a summoning eye, and they would be 9x as common as summoning eyes currently are. This would increase feedback for players grinding zealots, and also decrease price of summoning eyes so that dragons can be more affordable. This would also decrease the price of dragon armor, making it more accessible. To keep dragons from being too profitable for endgame players, super rare drops like dragon pets, and less rare drops like AOTD's should be more rare, and rely more on damage. Ex. dealing 1mil damage would make it impossible to get them even if you placed all 8 eyes, but placing 4 eyes and dealing 10mil damage will give you a much higher chance.\nTo the people who think this will decrease the price of dragon armor and midgame gear too much, remember that dragon armor isn't the final step in armor progression. There are many better armor sets, and making midgame a little easier to get to is needed to improve progression.\n\nProblem: Rare drops aren't rewarding\nSolution: Rare drops from echest zealots and other monsters/ores/nodes aren't rewarding at all, even to earlygame players. They were built with the skyblock community and progression from many months ago, and things have changed a lot. To improve feedback and give another incentive to visit the end island, Enderchest Zealots should be more rare, and actually have useful drops. (Ex. Summoning Eye Fragments, Remnants of the Eye, stuff of that type.) Overall, these drops need to be changed to be more fitting for the games current state.\n\nProblem: Fishing needs to be more engaging\nSolution: Fishing in most RPG, MMO, and Open World games is done very well, so the player feels rewarded and satisfied with the gear/items they got for the time they spent. Skyblock doesn't follow any standards for fishing, so it is therefore very boring. Fishing rod progression is actually amazing in my opinion, so I won't be touching on that too much. What does need to change, is loot. I'm not saying that there has to be loot that is more valuable for fishing, I'm saying that fishing needs to be more diverse. Sea creatures are great for this, so why not add more? While you're at it, add a fishing slayer! Seriously, adding epic fights with bosses to break up tedious tasks is a great idea, and it's what a lot of RPG games do. Skyblock already changes loot based on where you are fishing, but this needs to be stretched out a lot more. Like, a lot more. Having different places that drop significantly different loot will make fishing more strategic, and allow for personal discovery on good places to fish.\n(These are my personal opinions, I don't fish a lot so I'm open to a lot of feedback on this!)\n\nProblem: Dungeons class progression needs to be more balanced.\nSolution: Dungeons is by no means designed to be early or midgame content, as it is supposed to be content for people who have completed most of all other progression in skyblock. However, the decision on which class a player would like to pursue should happen a lot earlier. The current problem with class progression is that most good tank gear is extremely expensive, and mage gear is VERY expensive. Bozno staffs are around 9mil, and ink wands are around 1mil. This isn't stuff early-game players can obtain. More armor sets and magic weapons should be added for early-game players(they don't have to be good or very complex) so that players can figure out what skills and stats they would like to specialize in.\n\nProblem: Dungeons classes are unbalanced.\nSolution: I think the real problem with dungeons is how the classes are balanced. Now, don't get me wrong, the ideas and abilities for the classes are amazing, but they need some balancing. Intelligence scaling should get exponentially less powerful the higher your Intel gets, to nerf mage builds a bit. Abilities should deal more damage to account for the nerfs to intel regen. Archer should have damage and abilities buffed, and ranges attacks on other classes(except for mage) should be significantly reduced to introduce a need for archers in dungeon groups.\n\nJust to name a few more things, skills should have more rewards than just stat increases, collection values should be refined to encourage crafting/obtaining gear yourself instead of buying it. If we encourage players to explore and craft for their own gear, it will result in players have fun rather than just grinding for buying gear, which doesn't result in a lot of positive feedback.\n\nProblem: Players can grind an INSANE AMOUNT of slayer bosses without getting good RNG drops.\nSolution: Add slayer bosses to the Boss Collection tab, so that players can always get these drops if they grind enough\nCredit to @YeetusMeatus for idea/concept\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease reply with any other suggestions you have, I will be adding them to this thread with credit!\nI realize that I probably got some facts wrong and some topics here will probably be controversial.

(Game design reee)", "body": "Forums is flooded with tons of people complaining about the mage nerf, and I totally understand why! A class that was OP, is now terrible.\nI personally don\u2019t think admins will buff mage too much, but who knows.\n\nI\u2019m gonna take this time to explain game design practices for mage classes:\n\n1. Mages should be glass cannons. They should have to be protected, but should have high damage output.\n2. Mages are not intended to be spammy classes. In MMORPG game design practice, they are supposed to have a very limited amount of mana, but high damage. Cool downs shouldn\u2019t matter if mana cost is high for abilities. This encourages strategic use of abilities instead of just mindless spamming, making gameplay more balanced and fun.\n3. Intelligence shouldn\u2019t be changeable very much. MMORPG practice for intelligence/mana is to make it so there\u2019s a massive trade-off whenever you increase your intelligence. Ex. Reforges that increase intelligence also decrease defense and health. Most games also don\u2019t give the ability of mass-reforging talismans to give more intelligence, and heavily decrease intelligence earned by reforges/modifiers.\n\nI suggest:\nMana regen to be restored.\nCool downs be shortened.\nAll methods of obtaining higher intelligence should be significantly nerfed(which also nerfs mana regen)\nAbility costs be increased.\n\nNot all of my suggestions are perfect, I\u2019m just stating things that are normal practice for MMORPG and Open World games.\nHave a great day ;-;"}, {"title": "Looking for glitched items", "body": "I'm currently constructing a museum for glitched items and am buying any items i don't currently have.

Mage isn't like in normal games, with mage you just spam blockhit with certain items, and I don't think that is how mages are supposed to work. Healers have to resort to being a hybrid class instead of just being a healer, they have to be like a battle healer to be able to regen their mana. Other classes are kind of unbalanced, and yeah. Here are my suggestions.\n\nMage (don't kill me im not complaining about the nerf but just suggesting changes):\n\nRevoke the mana regen \"nerf\" because it makes other classes ultra hard to regen mana and also i feel like its not really the style of a mage.\n\nMake it so you just regen mana normally.\n\nRemove spammy weapons (dreadlord, bonzo) and add some BIG DAMAGE single hit weapons like voodoo doll (i think its very well designed and balanced, its a good burst of damage) Then add some items that maybe cast like a fireball and cost a lot of mana but do a lot of damage. This would make mage more strategic and mana management like what it is supposed to be instead of just block hitting lol.\n\nMaybe convert some of the old mage weapons (bonzo staff, etc) into weapons for other classes so they can have more variety\n\nHealer:\n\nMaybe add some items that can give mana to teammates to make healer\n\nadd more healing ITEMS, like item with abilities that heal, maybe even give buffs to other players\n\n\nOther classes:\n\ngib archor moar items\n\ni think berserk is gud idk i haven't really played it much\n\nmaybe more tank items too"}, {"title": "Change Suggestion to the Spirit Pet", "body": "Recently the with the addition of the 4th floor of dungeons we've gotten a new pet, the spirit pet.\n\nMost people I've spoken to think the pet is not worth it or even useless. I think that it is in fact a good pet and is really underrated. There are however a couple of things that I think need to be changed, tweaked, and fixed about it.\n\nFirst off. The item lore.\nThe Spirit pet spawns when you die in a dungeon. This is great because it automatically buffs you when you die. However, the lore only reads out that it assists you and doesn't mention how it assists you. I've had the opportunity to test out the spirit pet, of course totally intentionally and not because I died. The spirit pet (as a berserker) damages mobs for quite a good amount of damage and heals your teammates. I am not sure if it has a different effect for different classes but it would be nice if this was listed in either the dungeon guide or if the item lore was made a bit clearer. \n\n(Also, the spirit pet is currently bugged, if you have it and it auto equips it unequips and leaves you without a pet when you respawn. plz fix thonks)\n\nSecondly, the second perk.\nSpirit leaps are found in bountiful amounts. If you do enough secrets to make an attempt to get an S+ you will overflow with them. This makes the second perk quite useless as no one really is asking for more Spirit leaps. If above else however you do actually run out of spirit leaps you can always go to the auction house and find them for a pretty decent price. \n\nSo, what can we do to improve on the second perk?\nWell, there are a couple of suggestions that I think would greatly improve the Spirit pet and make it much more useful.\n\nFloor 4 introduced loads of new items to the game. A couple of which are the Spirit Bow and the Spirit Sword. These are both 'Spirit Items' and can be used as actual weapons when you die inside a dungeon so that you can still deal damage.\n\nIt would be great if the spirit pet buffed these weapons while dead inside a dungeon. I'm currently thinking a 2% or 1.75% damage increase per level when using spirit weapons (while dead) This is quite powerful though. I, therefore, suggest that this perk becomes the third (legendary pet perk) and gets swapped with the current third pet perk. \n\nI hereby also want to suggest a cool achievement that I thought of while writing this post.\n\n[Spirited Away]/[Boo!] +5 Achievement points\nSpawn a spirit pet after dying inside a dungeon.\n\nI hope that you like the suggestions and that they are taken into account because I'd find it very sad if this cool new pet went completely unnoticed and unused. \n\nPlease leave a comment with your thoughts!"}, {"title": "Question", "body": "how long does it take for you to firstly get kicked out of your sb island and the geting moved to afk when ur afk?"}, {"title": "Should a new dragon set be added to the game?", "body": "Show your thoughts, it would be better than superior and more expensive."}, {"title": "Bring back Wat", "body": "Skyblock related: Jerry needs r34"}, {"title": "Zealot counter not resetting", "body": "So today I was just grinding eyes like normal.

He will do an attack once per fight, where he spins around launching spotlights around the place where you\u2019re fighting him.

For the First two months I was a casual player and got Full Strong, Max AOTD and a skill average of about 16. I felt pretty acomplished. On the third month, I built a sugar cane farm and grinded milions of coins. \n\nPart 1: Dungeons\nDungeons finally came out. I rapidly sold all my gear and bought a Bonzo's Staff for 6 milion. I then added Ultimate Wise 4 and got a Sheep Pet. I was pretty happy with my new mage setup. I did around 50 floor 2 dungeon runs and got to Mage Lv 13. Mage was very fun to play, as I like being a glass cannon.\n\nPart 2: The Day of Reckoning.\nWe all knew it was going to happen. But none of us wanted it to happen. But the admins are ruthless*. ON July 31st, 2020, the Mage Class was nerfed. Now, we all knew it was going to happen and we were ready. But we weren't ready for the severity.\nLike, listen. A mage nerf was sensible and needed. But to nerf Mage THIS HARD! You must be out of your mind! Players grinded their *sses off to get all this gear, and you just make it Worthless?\nNow, the nerf of the gear is bad enough. But, the admins probably didn't realise the reprecussions.\n1. The Mages now couldn't switch to another class as the sell price of their items had gone down severely.\n2. Mages would have to grind up the class level if they were to switch.\nNow, making a perfectly balanced game is very difficult. Now, Archer is overpowered and will be nerfed.\nBut, there are better ways to do this than to destroy mage. I suggest that the admins take a look at the first 10 pages of the forums and look at the onslaught of angry players. In my opinion, mage should get rebuffed, but not to the point where it was at before. Just, to be as good as all the other classes. (berserker can easily 1 shot all the mobs without using mana & so can archer)\nThis is a comparison:\nBefore, I was easily able to kill a Lost Adventurer.\nNow, I ran out of mana, took around 1/4 of its hp and died.\nI hope that when Floor V releases, mage will be rebuffed."}, {"title": "zombie soldier + bonzos mask or dark goggles for mage", "body": "title"}, {"title": "The problem with mage(s)", "body": "DISCLAIMER: I was not a mage so I can not relate to the problems so I might have some biased opinions\n\nWell, Hypixel fucking did it. They nerfed the class that everyone knew was far too good. I mean, our primary berserker switched to mage because it was so fucking OP. He had the optimal berserker loadout and he switched to mage because that\u2019s how op it was. However, I have to say; even if I was getting a bit salty at not reaching milestones because my mages would just run in and fucking shred everything before I could get up close, nerfing it was the wrong move.\n\nI mean, you could make a case that the class had it coming, but right now I have to say I really do miss our mage\u2019s ability to solo minibosses. My current team now screams over the mic \u201c**** my ass dude shadow assassin on me\u201d and immediately the entire team comes swarming in. We have to, otherwise we get fucked and it just keeps killing the person trying to do it.\n\nI mean I am certainly not the first person to say it but they should have just added better stuff for each and every class. Mage is only good because you\u2019re paying for better stuff.The berserker stuff right now is just too weak for it\u2019s cost. It goes from 2-4m for decent damage to 50m for not much more. It\u2019s just to steep of a price leap for not enough stat bonuses. They should have added in better swords for berserker, better healing items for healers and better armor for tanks instead of nerfing the one class that was good as it was.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk"}, {"title": "Intentional or a bug?", "body": "As you know when you type something on a dungeon note and someone leaves and then you try again, its says that you cannot say the same message twice.

I will test it later...\" (and that's exactly what I did).\nWhile in dungeons, during the first run after first death I immediately noticed that the spirit bow is on my hotbar even though it supposed to be in my enderchest \"well... that's wierd, but maybe that suppose to work this way...\" ( I said... to myself... in my head... which is still thinking... I guess... )\nanyway now while I'm thinking about it, this \"wierd thing\" happened only in the first game but not during other runs... but didn't notice it back then and also wasn't checking if my spirit bow is still im my enderchest... beaceuse why wouldn't it be there ??\nAfter like few runs... which was like 1,5h I finally completed flor 4 and because dark ah was starting in like 2 min and because that spirt bow would be my main bow for now I decided to buy power VI for it... and I actually did... bought it on that dark ah...\nThe Moment has finally come... now I can enchant my brand new bow and use it... \nexcept... \n*opening ender chest sound* \n\nmy spirit bow IS GONE.\n\nmy first thoughts...\n\"\n...\n...\n...\nf*ck...\"\n\nI mean it's been a while since I put that bow into my ender chest so first thing I did, I started looking for it in my backpacks... then In chests on my island... unsuccessfuly...\n...well back then I wasn't really sure what happened I mean...

I also put 10 hpb on it... reforged it to precise... and r e c o m b o b u l a t e d it.\n...and went straing in to dungeons to test it...\nthat Spirit bow was always on my hotbar so everything was fine... it was better that my mythinc mosqito so I was glad that I bought it... what's more this bow is super op while you are a ghost...and I was able to deal even up to 300k per shot as a ghost and clear rooms while being invincible and flying around...

Of course, there are exceptions to this(such as Ultimate Wise) but by increasing the variety and overall usefulness of all available, I think the game could benefit. So here are a few of my ideas on what new enchants could be added as dungeon loot in lower floors.\n\nKnockback Resistance I-V: Decreases taken knockback by 5-30%. Does not work on abilities. (Armor Enchantment)\n\nDeflection I-V: 5-25% chance to deflect a projectile back at the enemy. The deflected projectile does 50-170% damage of the original projectile. (Armor Enchantment)\n\nBunny I-III: Increases a player's jump boost by 10-30%. (Armor Enchantment)\n\nSteel I-V: When shifted, lose 250-150% speed and gain 10-50% defense. (Armor Enchantment)\n\nUltimate Cleave I-V: Deals 10-50% damage dealt to target monsters to other monsters in a 3-7 block radius. (Weapon Enchantment)\n\nSpell I-V: Increases ability damage of item by 10-50%. (Weapon Enchantment)\n\nWave I-V: When a mob is hit, knocks back all mobs in a 3-7 block radius. (Weapon Enchantment)\n\nFreeze I-V: Freezes enemies in place for 0.5-2.5 seconds when a bow is fired at full charge. (Bow Enchantment)\n\nDuplicate I-II: 10-20% chance to fire 1-2 extra arrows. (Bow Enchantment)\n\nI think such enchantments will help add some variety to play styles, as well as balance some dungeons classes(Spell could balance Ult Wise, Steel could buff tank, etc.)\n\nThis is just my opinion.

I would like to suggest a rework to ONLY slayer runes. Before any defaults scream pAy2wIn, these runes should be applicable by any rank, limited only by runecrafting level, giving the defaults a chance to upgrade the runecrafting skill, but not view the rune effects. The difference would be that only ranked players can see the rune effect, but all players are given the buff. The idea is to give the runes a purpose, worthy of their rarity, in oppose to just cosmetic.\n\nRune 1: Couture Rune\nConsidering the rune is obtained from svens, the buff would be + X amount of magic find, and + X amount of true defense. Depending on the tier of rune (1 - 3), the buff would be multiplied accordingly.\n\nRune 2: Snake Rune\nThis rune is given through the revenant horror slayer boss. Similar to the Couture Rune, it supplies + X amount of magic find, but also gives + X number of hit tickers similar to the scorpion foil's ability. When the hit ticker is used up, you will deal + X percentage of damage to revenants. The cooldown between this ability will be decreased as the runes tier is upgraded.\n\nRune 3: Bite Rune\nThe bite rune is obtained from killing broodfathers. This rune will again add X amount of magic find per tier, with the main buff being that every X amount of hits from a broodfather you will take no knockback. Again, the cooldown of this will be determined by the tier of the rune.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading! I would also appreciate if you could discuss exactly what values to replace the X's should be, as I don't want to make it too op or useless. Also, depending on whether people like this idea or not, I may do the less rare slayer runes as well!\n\n\n\n\nI COULDNT FINISH IT, I WIL MAKE A NEW POST ABOUT THE FINISHED ONE, I HABVE A TON OF STUFF TO DO, HOPE YOU LICKED THIS!!\n\nPls bump to keep this alive!!"}, {"title": "MAGES MAD SO ITS SHOW TIMEEEEEE", "body": "It all started with me at hub 1, bored as always, so i started spamming my bonzo staff to village and colosseum, after like 20 minutes the first guy appeared.

(25+ Positive Reactions!)", "body": "Hello,\n\nRecently there has been a new patch, 30th of July where Catacombs floor 4 has been released and some major changes regarding dungeon classes has been implement. Focusing on mage class, according to the patch that \"Also a note on mage, I understand some players believe the class is now terrible, but it apparently is still the best performing class in the Dungeons right now. Give it a few days.\" which I feel like it's not true currently.\n\nMage Class Changes\n\nBonzo Staff Damage buffed from 500 to 1000 but scaling is now 0.2 NERF\nFrozen Scythe damage buffed from 500 to 1000 but scaling is now 0.3 NERF\nPigman Sword now has a 5 second cooldown and costs 400 mana (instead of 150) but has 300 intel, grants 200 defense instead of 50 and has 30000 base damage instead of 7500 NERF\nDreadlord Sword now has a very short cooldown BUFF\nSkulls from Dreadlord Swords and Soulstealer Bows are now easier to hit and deal AOE. BUFF\nMana Regen is nerfed by 80% inside dungeons, every hit on enemy mob gives back 5 mana + 1% of total mana. CAN'T SAY\nOther Class Changes\n\nMana Regen is nerfed by 65% for tank and berserker and 50% for archer and healer inside dungeons, every hit on enemy mob gives back 5 mana + 1% of total mana. NERF\n\nANALYSIS\nAs we can see that mages got some nerfs and buffs at a glance, but let's take a closer look at each changes.\n\nBonzo Staff Damage buffed from 500 to 1000 but scaling is now 0.2 at the first 8 words you'll see that it's really buffed but once you looked at the change after the \"but\" it is a drastic nerf. I tested this with my own damage, with Bonzo's Staff I dealt around 50k damage per cast before the patch now it only deals 10k damage per cast with the same setup, that's only 20% than what it used to be.\nFrozen Scythe damage buffed from 500 to 1000 but scaling is now 0.3 I don't have enough data to test this out by myself. According to some reports on the forum now that Frozen Scythe deals 33% damage than what it used to be. The damage I deal with Frozen Scythe now is around 12k per cast.\nPigman Sword now has a 5 second cooldown and costs 400 mana (instead of 150) but has 300 intel, grants 200 defense instead of 50 and has 30000 base damage instead of 7500 it was spammable, but now it's not, this render the Pigman Sword to be useless. I was able to spam the pigman sword around 30 times per 5 seconds means I was dealing 45k/dps. Now it can only deal 6k/dps which is a drastic nerf, making Pigman Sword to deal only 13% damage than what it used to be.\nDreadlord Sword now has a very short cooldown this is a nice change, but still won't be sufficient for higher floor dungeon since ice essence is out.\nSkulls from Dreadlord Swords and Soulstealer Bows are now easier to hit and deal AOE this is a nice change, but still Frozen Scythe is a little more useful.\nMana Regen is nerfed by 80% inside dungeons, every hit on enemy mob gives back 5 mana + 1% of total mana this one is a big RIP to mage class. Mage's ability to deal damage very dependent to mana, means a low mana regen even with the regen on hit still a drastic nerf since you won't be hitting mobs all the time in a dungeon run. Some people has said that this is a buff, but let's calculate this, mana regen was 2% max mana/second since there's a 90% nerf on mana regen we can get 0.2% max mana/s regeneration. So if we have 1000 max mana means we will only regen 2 mana instead of 20 mana. But there's a regen on hit, 5 mana + 1% max mana, Assuming we did 6cps which is the general average we'll be regenerating around 120 + 6% mana/s. It seems that it's a buff right? It's not, since you don't hit mobs all the time in the dungeon, let's assume you only hit 10% of the time and the rest is usualy used for exploring dungeon which is kinda true for me. means you'll regenerate 12 mana + 0.6% max mana. Combined you'll regenerate 12 mana + 1.22% max mana per second, with the assumption of 1000 max mana then you'll regenerate 20 mana/s rather than 20 mana/s. This actually doens't need a calculation since you can feel this inside the dungeon yourself.\nTHEORY\nTo come up with a solution we'll basing our solution on this RPG class theory.\n\nArcherDamageHighMobilityHighHealthLowAbilityEnhancing it's damage even further\n\n\nBerserkerDamageHighMobilityMediumHealthMediumAbilityAble to survive for a good amount of time\n\n\nHealerDamageLowMobilityMediumHealthMediumAbilityIncreasing survivability for self and the others\n\n\nMageDamageHighMobilityLowHealthMediumAbilityDealing controlled AOE damage\n\n\nTankDamageLowMobilityMediumHealthHighAbilityTaunt and survive longer than the others\n\nLet's count each point for each classes, Low=1; Medium=2; High=3.\nArcher 7 points\nBerserker 7 points\nHealer 5 points\nMage 6 points\nTank 6 points\nWhat does these points means? this point currently are only able to govern the effectiveness of each class according to each stats without considering it's ability.\n\nCURRENT CLASSES STATE\nArcher glass bow, deals good amount of damage but rlly easy to get killed\nBerserker glass diamond sword, deals tons of damage but pretty much weak because low survivability\nHealer kinda ok imo, but just a little bit tankier will help avoid 2-3 shotted by Shadow Assassin\nMage glass water pistol, since it has lower damage than berserker and squishy\nTank needs to be a little bit tankier imo.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nImplement a bell curve magic damage scaling so that a weapon will have an increasing return of damage so that these type of weapons will only be able to be used by high intelligence setups. You can use this function as a reference.\nRemoving or reducing cooldown from Pigman Sword. Allow it to be spammable while being controlled, ex: maximum of 3 casts in a second.\nRegenerate mana based on intelligence instead of max mana. This will result in a small nerf(pre-patch) that applies for all classes.\nBalancing classes according to the theory given by implementing changes on armors instead of dungeon exclusive effects.\nWhile there's alot of complaints about mages are too op, implement a damage resistance to some mobs(while not rendering mages useless against that mobs). This can also apply to physhical damage resistance.\nCONCLUSION\nHypixel Skyblock's Dungeon will need lots of changes overtime, looking at the fact is just came out this month. As of now the balancing that the admins are implementing are nerfing one class so hard. Instead of doing that, considering the difficulty of the dungeon there should be a small nerf for mage class and buffs for the other classes that's lacking. Implementing balancing from armors rather than dungeon exclusive effects to ensure initial plan result that is to allow player to be able to switch classes easily.\n\nThis is all based on my opinion and calculation.

(This is the first draft and we will most likely tweak those values over the next few days based on testing and feedback.)\nThis works on all melee attacks, arrow hits and mage beams (ranged attacks).\nUsing abilities should now require a bit more strategy, let us know what you think about those changes!\n\nGeneral Changes\nMany tweaks, new features and bug fixes are rolling in this patch:\n\nAggro system should now work a lot better, but it is currently disabled during boss fights because of issues we could not fix on time.\nNo Pain No Gain enchantment buffed from 2 to 50 orbs.\nFixed a damage bug that would apply the Berserk melee damage buff to all kind of damage, and the Archer melee debuff to all kind of damage. (so Archer would deal less arrow and ability damage due to that).\nItem Ability messages will now appear in the action bar instead of the chat.\nWe are experimenting with magic damage reduction on some Dungeon monsters, for starter the Chaos Guardian and Withermancers will now take reduced damage from abilities.\nRemoved Adaptive boots.\nThe Silent Death' lore now shows that it refreshes on kills.\nThe Guardians now respawn slower during the Professor fight.\nThe unstable version of the lost Adventurer now deals lightning damage and the Holy version heals.\nRemoved a box puzzle variant and added different puzzle variants.\nSpirit Mask got a few stat buffs and is now removed.\nThanks for reading!\nPlease test the mana changes and give us your feedback, keep in mind this is the first draft and we will very likely improve the system based on your feedback.\n\nEDIT: Quick patch\n\nThe mana regen ticks are now rounded up.\nNon-mage classes mana debuff is now 95% instead of 75%.\nMob cap during Thorn fight is now 200, from 150.\nMore changes coming later.\nAlso a note on mage, I understand some players believe the class is now terrible, but it apparently is still the best performing class in the Dungeons right now. Give it a few days.\n\nEDIT 2: Other quick patch\n\nLess Spirit mobs are now spawning in the later waves (around 5% less).\nFixed an issue with the spirit bow being able to be moved around in your hotbar.\nFixed Spirit bunnies sometimes staying after the fight ends.\nFixed Dungeon Chest Key being an accessory.\nFixed the Mythic Spirit Pet having the Mythic perk.\nThe Spirit Pet works even when not selected, so when you become a ghost it'll pop up as long as you own it.\n\nEDIT 3: One more quick patch\n\nFixed an issue with Spirit Bats preventing waves to spawn sometimes.\nBuffed based Floor 4 EXP from 800 to 1000\nDeleted Wizard.\nProbably the last patch of the night. We noted a few more bugs that we will try to fix soon.

Some of these things you may have heard of some you may not have, some you will agree with, some not. But that is not the point of this thread. The point of this thread is to offer constructive criticism from a wealthy, experienced Skyblock player.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200b\nTo begin, I am NOT someone with much patience/the ability or desire to grind much. This has caused problems for me as this game is highly focused around grinding. You HAVE to grind to get somewhere. I found a way to bypass this in a way, flipping. Flipping is where you look for opportunities when buying/selling, anything to make you money. This is EXTREMELY hard and is even harder for beginners, but the richer you are, the bigger your profits. Now however, Skyblock is trying to get rid of this in various ways.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200b\nPlayers are unfairly banned based on assumptions and appearances. @Simon himself said he will not ban anyone unless they are 100% SURE that the player has committed an offense. Then what are these false bans? I\u2019ll tell you, they go about banning and wiping profiles that just look a little suspicious. Most often these people are just very successful flippers. Suspicious in skyblock basically means you have a lot of money, but not necessarily the most impressive stats. I mean, sure some people are not following the rules, but certainly not as many as are accused.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGame Function\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200b\nRNG. Some people hate it, some love it. I have almost never gotten a good rng drop. No good slayer drops, no good other mob drops, no good dungeon drops and rewards, nothing. But then we have a non(mindset) in ender armor killing some topfloor endermen, boom! They get a Phoenix. Why is this a thing? Well healthy RNG is definitely needed, but such a great pet(has 60 strength(more strength than any other pet, 150 intelligence(more than even the sheep)) available to such a noob? Then you have experienced players not getting an RNG drop after 1,000 svens or tarantulas. This is NOT healthy RNG. A good solution would be adding a lot more drops to boss collections/a new thing called mob collections which unlocks new drops/gives you a drop after a certain amount of kills of a certain mon\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200b-before the **** update- Dungeon Classes. Right now(here is where you will disagree) the only balanced class is mage. Before you disagree, let me explain. Balanced can go both ways, less and more. The other classes are less for the most part. For example archer does no damage even though that\u2019s kinda what the class is supposed to do, berserker does damage, but is a glass cannon and can\u2019t really get close enough without dying to take on some of the more challenging mobs. My one issue about mage involves a weapon, bonzo staff, it makes knockback, I find myself flying backwards when I use it, but I don\u2019t have another alternative because of how much the frozen scythe was nerfed. There is much more on this topic, but I have to go on.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200bSlayers- slayers are so irritating due to other people being clueless and making your boss move around away from you or causing you to die somehow. RNG for slayers also needs to be worked on, but I already talked about RNG, so I\u2019m not going over that right now. Biggest issues for slayers are tied between nons (Mindset) and glitches. Nons cause you to die or move you slayer across the map, and glitches, especially with tarantulas can cause mobs to get stuck in walls and stuff making them untouchable but they still deal massive amounts of damages. This needs to be fixed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200bOvercrowding. Overcrowding makes the game hard, especially when grinding zealots or chopping wood, or getting combat XP for slayers, it\u2019s harder than it should be. This needs to be fixed. Maybe add new maps or something.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200bAt the moment, progression is very broken, most players can get Dragon Armor in a matter of weeks, this is supposed to be an end game armor. This is a problem, and this problem isn't limited to just armor, its all progression(except fishing rods maybe). In fact, for dungeons, there is no real progression, its just a matter of what gear is best because it is all affordable for those who play, end game players. Dungeons is clearly focused on end game players who deal many thousands of damage verses early & mid game players who deal 1-5000 damage. This is, again, broken. To fix this, I propose adding more content- new armors(better endgame armor is needed as well as mid game), new places(see my idea in my signature, that's a possible concept, also make places like the end & gazing fortress more challenging and rewarding), weapons are fine I guess, as for talismans, its difficult to track them all down, and we rely to heavily on them. Stuff like this would help.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFeedback, Opinions, People, and More!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200b\nIdeas and feedback ignored: there are sooooo many amazing, brilliant, creative ideas on forums ignored. I\u2019m particularly salty about this due to the shear amount of time and effort I have put into some ideas I\u2019ve made. A solution that could be implemented is maybe adding a new forums staff that looks for good ideas, and when they find them, they then bring them to the developers/admins attention to have the possibility of being added to the game.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u200b\nYouTube favoritism, all I can really say about this is it\u2019s actually kinda fair- they advert for free abs without them hypixel wouldn\u2019t have nearly the same amount of players.

Sure the lack of mana will decrease your survival rate a lot, but pretty sure this can be ignored if your movements are fine and is careful in dungeons. (note: archer probs wont get a good gear update compared to mage and berserker, as you can see the newest \"archer item update\" is spirit bow and its trash and only helps while you are dead, which means useless)\n\n#2: Mage\nSurprised huh? Everyone says mage bad after the mana regen reduction update, but the truth is its not heavily nerfed and keep its advantages. Rn mage's mana regen rate is 20%, and the lazers only regen 1% of the mana when hits a target, but keep in mind your teammate counts as a target too, and you can spam lazers on your teammte and regen in no time (tbh i think they capped lazer mana regen to 5% mana per second, so just 5cps is enough), or you can both left and right click while using your mage weapon, that can almost cancel out the mana regen nerf in this update, poggers. Well bonzo staff and pigman are both nerfed hardly, but bonzo staff still deals a lot of damage if spammed (no cd pog, start butterfly clicking), pigman? say rip to it lol. Also dont forget mage can deal splash damage with mage weapons (ice scythe ew) and this really helps a lot in dungeons, especially f4 when the bear literally melts in the crowd of animals. At last mana is fwuking free so abuse aote all the time and dodge every skeletor arrow and crypt bones, and you are basically unkillable. (note: high potential, consistent mage item upgrade, its not going to be bad in a few months if the admins are designing properly)\n\n#3: Berserker\nDont even need to explain, semi tank with high dps, can soak in the animal swarm with no problem, and knocking bear away from the animal crowd is a pog move, also can explore the dungeon rooms safely because of the tankness and dps. The ultimate is cool too, low cd and you get zombies to do the killing job for you while you are finding secrets, one man army 100%. (note: consistent update on berserker items too, swords and armor are the most easiest to design, and the admins definitely will spam more of them)\n\n#4: Healer\nShould be #1 in the first 3 days that released new floor, insane auto revive, auto heal when your health is low, and heal all teammates to full health and give insane absorption shield per 2min, overpower when paired with the \"hint teammate low on health\" function in chattriggers' dungeonutilities, having a healer means you cant fail a dungeon when playing normally, also its a good mage alternative, as it only have 65% mana regen reduction, and you can survive much easier when soloing rooms as mage-based healer. (note: hopefully admins will design more healing items, zombie sword trash with ticks rn, they forgot about healing items tho)\n\n#5: Tank\nWorst, f4 mobs arent dealing THAT high damage, even archers can survive a few hits, tank just isnt that helpful in general, berserker and mage can do what a tank can do, and even better... tanking mobs? mage can disintegrate them in seconds while tanking them, and berserker the same but slower... even more useless after the first week of f4, everyone is gonna tank f4 mobs easily, and tank just cant help anymore, also with sa shadow nerfed (low damage now lol), tank is even worse.

This has made many upset. So before we start, this is just a disclaimer, I AM a mage, however I will do my best to not let bias interfere with this thread as I do not want this to just pass by the admins & forums as just a rant from a mage. I want this to be a meaningful thread that will help spark action to change the current effects. Without further ado, I present my thread:\n\nProblems\n\nHere I will be listing the current problems with this most recent update. However, first things, first, I will give you the patch notes so you can read it if you so desire to see just what I am talking about: http://hypixel.net/threads/july-30-floor-4-and-other-changes.3186966/\n\nHere are the changes with weapons listed in the patch notes,most of which I dislike:\n\nBonzo Staff damage buffed from 500 to 1000 but scaling is now 0.2\nFrozen Scythe damage buffed from 500 to 1000 but scaling is now 0.3\nPigman Sword now has a 5 second cooldown and costs 400 mana (instead of 150) but has 300 intel, grants 200 defense instead of 50 and has 30000 base damage instead of 7500\nDreadlord Sword now has a very short cooldown\nSkulls from Dreadlord Swords and Soulstealer Bows are now easier to hit and deal AOE.\nLet's review some of these changes now. Bonzo staff has had its base damage doubled, but lost a ton in its scaling. This is good for players with little mana, but the more mana you have, the less good it is compared to how it used to be. Frozen Scythe, I believe around July 14th, it was nerfed EXTREMELY hard to the point it was worse than its counterpart, Bonzo's staff, which was 1/4 of the price. Of course after this change the price sunk from around 20M-30M to 9-13M, which is still double Bonzo's staff even though Bonzo's staff is now better because it can shoot faster(which makes up for the mana cost difference). This poor weapon does not deserve this further nerf(also by the way, here they make it look better, but that does not include shooting speed.) Now for the worst part of this, the Pigman sword nerf. While it may seem like a buff, the 5 second cooldown is an EXTREME nerf. Here's why: The way mage class players would use it is that they would spam the ability, which 1 time it may not deal very much DPS(damage per second), but when you have 10, even 20+ stacked, it deals enough damage to take out hard mobs in seconds. This made it extremely expensive, but very useful. With the 5 second cooldown, the huge buff in base damage and defense does not matter as it does not deal nearly the same DPS.\n\nHere's the magic damage formula & stuff included in the patch notes for reference:\n\n\nSpoiler: Magic Damage\n\n\n\nThe magic damage formula would read something like:\nfinal damage = ability damage * ((1 + intelligence / 100) * ability scaling))\n\nWhen it should have been\nfinal damage = ability damage * (1+ ( intelligence / 100) * ability scaling))\n\nWhich essentially means that the damage multiplier was always reduced by 1.\n\nSo in the case of the Pigman Sword for example, in the scenario where a player had 1000 intelligence, the formula would be:\n\nPigman Sword damage = 30000 *((1 + 1000 / 100) * 0.1))\nSo 30000 * 1.001\nWhich equals 30030 total damage\n\nWith the correct formula the pigman sword would deal:\nPigman Sword damage = 30000 *(1+ ( 2590 / 100) * 0.1))\nSo 30000 * 2\nWhich equals 60000 total damage\n\nThis affected everyone, but it was a lot more severe on players with low intelligence values.\n\nLet's take the example of a player using the Bonzo staff with 500 intelligence total:\nFormula with typo: 1000 *((1 + 500 / 100) * 0.2)) = 1001 Damage\nFormula without typo: 1000 *(1+ ( 500 / 100) * 0.2)) = 2000 Damage\nThe fix doubles the damage of Bonzo staff on players with only 500 intelligence.\n\nNow let's take the example of a player using the Bonzo staff with 5000 intelligence total:\nFormula with typo: 1000 *((1 + 5000 / 100) * 0.2)) = 10001 Damage\nFormula without typo: 1000 *(1+ ( 5000 / 100) * 0.2)) = 11000 Damage\nFor this player the fix only increases his damage by 10%\n\nAll those damage values are of course calculated only looking at magic damage scaling, other things apply to magic damage, like the Combat skill passive, items increasing ability damage (like shadow goggles) etc.\n\nTLDR; this fix should mostly affect players with lower Intel values, but could result in a very large damage increase.\n\n\n\nNow for why people wanted some of these nerfs(of course not all wanted it this severely). The most common reason people wanted these weapons nerfed was because \"mage was op,\" it in short dealt too much damge compared to other classes. I argue that the mage was the only class dealing enough damage, and that the other classes were under performing. Of course, I was proven correct with the release of floor 4. What happened was that the mobs had a lot more health and this made a problem, as teams were not dealing enough damage. This makes it very hard to achieve an S rank. While some may still hold their opinions that mage dealt too much damage, I will show you that that is not the case.\n\n-Point 1: Early floors = easy for most players. This means floor 0-3. The reason for this is that the mobs are a lot weaker- less DPS and health. This is why the mage would shred these floors. One thing that most people ignored was that people were mostly using the expensive, endgame weapons which are supposed to deal a lot of damage verses things like the leaping sword, ember rod, dreadlord sword, etc. My point: in later floors, if we nerf the best mage weapons, they will not be able to perform due to not dealing enough damage to combat these later mobs.\n\n-Point 2: Other DPS classes were not performing as well as they should've, pretty easy to see if you look in the right places; archer, beserker- should be dealing enough damage to almost one-shot most mobs in the dungeons.\n\n-Point 3: Mage was meta not because it was OP, but because it was easiest, just spam abilities, and boom, you've passed the floor.\n\nNext thing that I will be complaining about is what most other players were complaining about; mana regeneration. Here is what the patch notes said for reference:\n\n\"On top of that we changed how Mana Regeneration works inside dungeons.\nMana Regen will now be nerfed by 90% inside Dungeons, however players gain back mana when hitting enemy monsters.\nEvery hit on an enemy mob gives back 5 mana + 1% of your total mana. (This is a first draft and we will most likely tweak those values over the next few days based on testing and feedback.)\nThis works on all melee attacks, arrow hits and mage beams (ranged attacks).\nUsing abilities should now require a bit more strategy, let us know what you think about those changes!\"\n\nThis is a HUGE issue. This wrecks the essence of the mage; mana & magic attacks. We cannot be mages if we do not get enough mana, after one room now, we are completely exhausted of our mana and it'll take 10+ minutes to regenerate that. This gives us no chance of getting S rank. This is also tough for other classes as mana is needed for healing and other abilities, therefore this needs to be reverted.\n\nSolutions\n\nPretty much what I have here, I have already stated in another thread:\nhttps://hypixel.net/threads/july-31-dungeon-loot-magic-damage-and-other-changes.3190745/(fake but hopeful patch notes wanna be)\n\nBut what I said is pretty much revert all the most recent changes, then make mage what it is supposed to be; a glass cannon; deals tons of damage but is fragile. To do this I suggest taking away ~40% of mage health and defense, may be too much, or may be too little, but I tried.\n\nAlso, I almost forgot, thanks @MrEevee7 , the pigman sword. To counter mages from getting a ton of defense and becoming invincible, I propose that the defense does not stack(but the damage still does). Hopefully this should help!\n\nConclusion\n\nThanks for reading! If you are an admin/dev/staff member, thank you for reading this far and please share this with your fellow staff members!

It\u2019s pretty obvious that people enjoy the game, as it gets thousands of players every day. Despite this, if you really think about it, it\u2019s kinda trash. If you want to get anywhere in SkyBlock, you are forced to do the same tasks, over and over and over again, without any changes or differences. Some people may enjoy this, but personally I think it gets old fast, and would rather give my coins away in Housing events than spend it on marginally better stats that will get nerfed later on anyway. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s how it should be, I\u2019m saying that\u2019s how it is.\n\nChapter 2\nThe Mess We\u2019re In\nThe main reason I play SkyBlock is for the satisfaction of reaching your personal goal. For example when buying my AOTD, I spent weeks grinding to save enough money to get it. And as soon as I bought it, the moment I clicked that \u201cbuy it now\u201d button, that\u2019s the moment it stopped being fun. Why? Because in my opinion, when you start mid-game, SkyBlock gets old. You just have to grind zealots, thousands per day to get anywhere. You might say \u201cthere\u2019s other ways of getting money\u201d, sure, but are they any different? Bazaar flipping - clicking buttons in a GUI until the end of time. Farming - harvesting layer after layer with no difference. All money making methods are the same thing. Every time. But what if you don\u2019t want to use a money making method? Then you won\u2019t get anywhere, at all.\n\nChapter 3\nSkills\nThe skill dynamic is garbage as well. Foraging, mining, fishing, alchemy and enchanting are especially the worst. And yes, that\u2019s half the skills right there. Let\u2019s take foraging for example, literally, the ONLY thing you can do to level that up is break logs (or pick flowers if you\u2019re weird). There\u2019s not a single thing that theoretically could happen whilst foraging. What if, similar to animal crossing, some wasps attacked you whilst breaking a tree? Something different. Anything different. There was a foraging update which added a whole new island, wolf slayer cave (yay), and even a quest which costs millions to complete. And what did it add to the actual skill of foraging? Nothing.\n\nChapter 4\nSlayers, Dungeons, and The Ever-Growing Sense of Frustration\nLet\u2019s talk about RNG. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad mechanic, but too much of it can really make a game annoying, frustrating, and most importantly, trash. I can name so many things that require RNG to get right off the top of my head, but to save space, I\u2019ll just list a few. Summoning eyes, pet rarities, slayer drops, pet drops, dungeon chest loot, armor drops and worst of all - dragons. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s getting better. With the addition of the dungeon boss skills, you\u2019ll get a guaranteed item every milestone. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s not terrible.\n\nChapter 5\nImproving the Dynamic of the Game as a Whole\nI get it. The admins want the game to be a persistent MMORPG, with aspects of RNG and grinding. We can have that, as well as a fun minigame for all to enjoy, if we just make the right decisions. Take SkyBlock down for a day, hire some developers to work on content, improve the mechanic of doing the same tasks on repeat. Get the HPC and MVP++ to beta test new features, so you don\u2019t have to nerf/buff them later on. It\u2019s annoying grinding for a good item just to get it nerfed.

Like it should take a bit but not take about an hour\n\n- It's Just Boring : The dungeon itself is fine but the boss is just mind numbing as all you do is stand in place right clicking for about 5-30 minutes depending on your team. Dungeons are supposed to be fun not just sitting there. I was never bored with the other floors as you are moving & doing something.\n\n- Lack Of Better Armor: With this update tank, healer & mage were the only classes to get armor upgrade. Archer & Berserkers didn't get any new (better) gear. For Example: Archer can only use adaptive on f4, you will get insta killed if you used anything else.\n\nHow To Improve It:\n-Faster Boss Encounter - Make the time needed/mobs killed to spawn Spirit Bear less as it can take several minutes for the bear to spawn & you are just left sitting there waiting. Like it should take a bit but not take about an hour\n\n- More Armor For Archers & Berserkers : This doesn't have to major, even just decently buffing the previous floor's gear when dropped on f4 would do.

It brought many new items and concepts to the game itself. But, through all this, one thing has plagued dungeons this entire time, competitiveness. \n\n\nThe Hype of Dungeons\n\nI started playing around March of 2020. This is when Covid-19 hit. Player base rose to nearly 100k players at peak times, which means that more people were joining Skyblock. Every week it seemed as though there was a thread hyping for Dungeons. Then, after waiting for almost a year, we got the Reforge Update. On July 1st, Jayavarmen announced that the entire reforge system was going to be balanced and changed, in preparation for Dungeons. Now, people started to anticipate Dungeons even more. Rumors went around daily of dates of when they were going to release. Then, on July 7, Dungeons released to the public. When it first released, it was only open to MVP++, but it started to slowly let others in. Constant lag was a problem during this time and in the days after. Everything was alright for now, but, as time ensued, the bigger problem soon took over. \n\nThe Overall Problem with Dungeons\n\nSo, what went wrong? In order to understand this, we need to go back to the End Update. Before the End Update, the only real boss to fight was the Magma Cube Boss. Then, once the End Update came, Dragons were introduced along with other sets. Like Dungeons, it was all good at first because everyone was new to the update, but then it got competitive. People started fighting for Zealots, Dragons were only for the rich, and community eventually went downhill. This can easily relate to Dungeons. Dungeons was supposed to be an activity where you could play with friends together, working as a team, to kill a boss and receive some loot. However, this is not the case. In the beginning, everyone was Level 0, and everyone accepted each other because they were all just trying to play it. But then, as time went on, players grew in level, they grew in competitiveness. Now, Dungeons has become a grind. I see myself just coming on to maintain my level, because I might drop below the average. It became less of a fun activity to do with other people, less of a team effort to reach a goal, and more of a grind and more of a money grab to be. Dungeons was supposed to be an activity for all types of players, the casuals and the more determined ones, for early and end-game players, but it has instead, like all updates, fell into the favor of the devoted end-game community. This has blocked out the chance for more unexperienced players who have lower levels or who aren't as good as the grinders.\n\n\nThe Future of Hypixel Skyblock\n\nI see the future of Hypixel Skyblock to be, sadly, a slow demise. Hypixel is currently stuck in a pit, they are attempting to cater towards the End-Game community to keep them playing, while at the same time, they are making it harder for the Early-Game community to reach these new updates. This evidently means that the End-Game community will eventually die out, and it softlocks the Early-Game community who have to spend absurd amounts of time to reach the End-Game content. Once the End-Game community dies out, the Auction House, which is directly tied to having a large player base to survive, will die out. The economy crashes, and Hypixel Skyblock will fade into obscurity. Now, when will this happen? I predict in around 2 years. The Admins can release as much content as they want, but eventually, they will come to a roadblock. \n\n\nIf you actually read this, thanks for reading this. I will update this based off of questions in comments.\n\nTL;DR - Dungeons was supposed to be team oriented, became grindy. Skyblock will eventually die off due to Early Players being unable to reach new content."}, {"title": "why I dislike thorn boss fight", "body": "1) its long, like rl long\n2) its not boss difficuly hard, just compare it to dreadlords or skele masters\n3) its annoying af\n4) even if you get bow there is timer which is deadly connected with lags"}, {"title": "Can you recombobulate an recombobulator", "body": "Can you Recombobulate an Recombobulator??? and if you do can you use the Recombobulated Recombobulator to Recombobulate???

Protector dragon takes reduced damage, Young dragon has good speed, etc, and that's all that dragons really are.\nSo here's my suggestion (to rework/upgrade dragons).\n\nMy main ideas:\n\n\nSpoiler: The Dragons!\n\n\n\nSo here, I want to make the dragons themselves have different abilities (based on their armor sets) and buffs.\nAlso, when in the range of a dragon, you only know its health. So I think that a separate on-screen menu for their health, damage, and mana will be shown.\nHealth is just basically like normal health.\nDamage is basically normal damage.\nNow mana. Mana is going to be basically the same thing normal players have, except the mana regen and cap varies for each dragon. The dragon would have, maybe bots/a.i. that automatically guesses which ability to use. For example, if there are 3 abilities, speed increase, health boost, and damage boost, then while its health is very low, then it could use health boost. When it is about to be hit with arrows, it could increase speed. When it is about to attack players, it could damage boost. These may be overpowered or very strange, so you could easily change these to different abilities and different moments where the abilities are used.\nI also think that a good idea would be to incorporate vanilla minecraft's \"Dragon Breath\". It won't be the item itself (with glass bottles and potions), but instead it would be a sort of fireball that stays where it hit, sort of decreasing the players' abilities to choose one good spot to attack the dragon. This may be annoying at times, since it basically damages players that touch the breath, but with enough regeneration orbs (maybe with radiant or mana flux), it can easily be countered/ignored. Also, it might be cool if it occasionally did True Damage, so that the regeneration orbs might not be enough.\nPlease note that when I say something like \"regeneration of 10,000 healthpoints/second\", this number can easily be changed to 5,000 or 100,000 or anything. All I am saying below are merely estimates and can easily be changed into something that would fit the game more. Because I am limited on information about these dragons' statistics and their behavior and I can't test these out to judge it for myself, please understand that these numbers can be very off and that they can be changed. Thank you.\n\nNow let's get into specifics for each dragon and my ideas on them.\n\n\nSpoiler: Old Dragon\n\n\n\nNow, Old Dragon is, to be honest, pathetic and is often ignored by late-game/end-game players. The armor is easily worse than most of the other dragon armors and doesn't give a big buff. The dragon itself is just a normal ender dragon, basically. So here's my idea on a rework.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the armor's set bonus is. The bonus buffs growth, protection, feather falling, sugar rush, and true protection enchants. That's basically it.\nSo I wanted to incorporate that into the dragon itself and its abilities and mechanics.\nIt would have 3 abilities.\n1) Health Boost! Gives 100,000 absorption health and 5 seconds of regeneration for 10,000 healthpoints/second. Costs 400 mana.\n2) Damage Boost! Gives large damage boost and deals 300 true damage to its next 3 targets. Costs 500 mana.\n3) Speed Boost! Allows speed to reach 150 max for 3 seconds. Costs 500 mana.\nIt would have a total of 750 mana and a regeneration of 25 mana per second.\nWhen spawned, the dragon will fly around normally.\nWhenever it can, it will rush towards nearest players and activate Damage Boost.\nWhen it is low on health or its health is depleting fast, it will activate Health Boost.\nWhen there are too many arrows behind it or players are hitting it with a sword too much, it can quickly move away with Speed Boost.\nDuring the battle, it can occasionally shoot dragon's breath, with a 20% chance that it deals true damage.\nThe Old Dragon will still be relatively slow and weak, but it will still have the most health and largest amounts of ability buffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Protector Dragon\n\n\n\nPossibly the worst dragon armor of all time. It's not too bad in terms of health+defense, but it's terrible in everything else. The Protector Dragon itself is just a normal ender dragon except it takes less damage generally.\nFirst, the armor set bonus. It increases defense by 1% for each percent of missing health, meaning that the smaller amount of health you have, the more protected you become. Now in the dragon itself, it might be difficult to increase defense, since increasing defense too much will be too overpowered and will cause long dragon fights, which people don't like. So instead of defense increase, it would be damage increase.\nIt would have 1 main ability.\n1) Protector Rage! For each percent of missing health, increase damage of the next 10 seconds by 50. Costs 500 mana.\nIt would have 500 total mana and regen of 25 mana per second.\nWhen the mana cap is reached, it will automatically use the Protector Rage ability.\nAlso, if the dragon is very very low, then the percent of missing health could be, say, 99%, so 99*50 = 4950, so it would be able to deal 4950 damage. Don't worry, it's not true damage.\nIt also shoots dragon's breath occasionally.\nI don't really know what else to do for protector dragon, since the armor set bonus is relatively bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Wise Dragon\n\n\n\nNow, more interesting stuff. The wise dragon armor is useful for stuff like races and mana in general.\nThe armor set bonus is that abilities cost less mana.\nSo in the dragon itself, it would have more mana and would do more frequent actions/abilities.\nIt would have multiple abilities:\n1) Instant Transmission! Teleport 10 blocks forwards and gain a speed boost of 100 for next 5 seconds. Costs 400 mana.\n2) Homing Fireballs! Shoot 5 fireballs that home towards the nearest players and deal 1000 damage. Costs 750 mana.\n3) Mana Steal! Steal all of the mana from the players within 10 blocks. 30 second cooldown.\n4) Fireball Volley! Shoot 10 fireballs towards random players dealing 500 area damage each. Can knock players up and hit all players near the explosion. Costs 300 mana.\n5) Lightning Strike! Strike 5 random players in the Dragon's Nest dealing 300 true damage. Costs 200 mana.\nIt would have a total of 1000 mana and a regen of 50 mana per second.\nIn Mana Steal ability, no mana is used. It will also go near players every 30 seconds, meaning that although it gains mana, it also is a good target for many players to attack it while it steals mana.\nInstant Transmission is basically aspect of the end ability, except for wise dragons.\nThe a.i. for this one may be relatively difficult, but I think the mana steal ability would be pretty cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Unstable Dragon\n\n\n\nUnstable armor is also one of those armors that are okay by itself but is better to buy other armors instead of it. It boosts crit chance and crit damage and it also sometimes strikes nearby mobs.\nSo here's my thoughts on its abilities:\n1) Lightning Strike! Strikes all nearby players within 10 blocks dealing 1500 damage. Costs 300 mana.\n2) Stun Attack! All players are stunned for 3 seconds, unable to do anything (includes moving, using abilities, placing/breaking blocks, throwing/shooting projectiles, and attacking). Costs 400 mana.\n3) Electric Charge! Shoots 5 bolts of lightning from its mouth to the 5 strongest players, dealing 1000 damage, then 100 damage/second for the next 10 seconds. 45 second cooldown and costs 450 mana.\nIt has a total of 500 mana and a regen of 25 mana per second.\nThe electric charge basically is like an instant damage potion and a poison potion immediately after, except with a lightning bolt and \"shocks\".\nThe abilities are, as you can see, based largely off of the armor's set bonus and lightning.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Young Dragon\n\n\n\nYoung armor is used very often because of it being the only armor to give large amounts of speed infinitely. The Young Dragon is already a fast dragon resembling its armor, so I will base the abilities off of that.\n1) Speed Boost! Gains +50 flight speed for next 10 seconds of flight. Costs 200 mana.\n2) Tank! Temporarily slows down to normal ender dragon speed, but gets a boost of strength and defense for next 10 seconds. Costs 300 mana.\n3) Lightning Speed! While flying, deal 5x damage through a lightning bolt towards nearest players. Costs 300 mana.\n4) Speed Steal! Make all players in Dragon's Nest have a speed of 1. Costs 400 mana.\n5) Speed Regeneration! For each percent of missing health, heal 100 hp/second for 10 seconds, while decreasing speed by 50. Costs 450 mana.\nIt has a total of 500 mana with 25 mana regen per second.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Strong Dragon\n\n\n\nOf course, the strong dragon. Probably the 2nd best dragon armor in the game. Although the set bonus isn't really useful (buffing aote), the pieces themselves buff strength by a large amount, making it very useful.\nSo here are some abilities I based off of that:\n1) Strength Boost! Boosts Strength by 100 for the next 10 seconds. Costs 200 mana.\n2) Strength Delete! All players in Dragon's Nest do the amount of damage they do with a fist for 10 seconds (applies to weapons and bows). Costs 300 mana.\n3) Fire Strike! Shoots fireball to middle of Dragon's Nest causing all players in Dragon's Nest to take 10 seconds of lava/fire damage regardless of fire-related talismans. Costs 400 mana.\n4) Fireball Barrage! Shoots multiple fireballs towards players dealing fire damage and explosion and area damage. Costs 200 mana.\n5) Aspect of the End! Teleports 10 blocks forwards. For each percent of health missing, regenerate 1000 health per second for 10 seconds, deal 100 more damage for next 10 seconds, and increase speed by 10%. Also have a 10% chance that it dodges any attack. Costs 500 mana.\nIt has a total of 500 mana with 25 mana regen per second.\nJust some additional information: When dodging any attack, it just means that when an arrow was supposed to hit it, it won't take damage. So if you're really unlucky, then while hitting the dragon with a sword, you might do 0 damage while the dragon has the ability activated. Also, when regenerating 1000 health per second for 10 seconds for each percent of health missing, then if it's at a very very low health, then it would regen almost 100% * 1000 health * 10 seconds = 1,000,000 health total. That's 1/9 of a strong dragons entire health. Not too overpowered, but definitely not negligible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Superior Dragon\n\n\n\nOf course, the superior dragon. It's considered the best dragon armor (I repeat, dragon armor, not general armor) in the game. The set bonus increases all stats by 5% and aotd ability deals 50% more damage. Since it gives the best dragon armor, it should be the most difficult dragon to beat.\nSo here are some abilities I thought of:\n1) Stat Boost! Increases all stats currently (health, defense, damage, strength, mana, and speed) by 5% for the next 10 seconds. Costs 200 mana.\n2) Power Drain! Halves all stats of every player in the Dragon's Nest (health, defense, damage, strength, intelligence, crit chance/damage, etc) for next 10 seconds. Costs 500 mana.\n3) Rage! For the amount of health missing, deal 1% of that more in each attack for next 5 seconds. Costs 300 mana.\n4) Crystal Explosion! Summon end crystals near all players and have them self destruct, dealing area damage and knockback. Costs 400 mana.\n5) Endermen Strike! For every 3 players in the lobby, spawn an (9k health) enderman on players to attack them (these do not drop pets). Costs 400 mana.\n6) Fireballs! Shoot large amounts of fireballs towards the 5 strongest players (most health + defense + strength + damage). Costs 400 mana.\n7) Aspect of the Dragons. Summon one slightly smaller ender dragon (old, protector, wise, young, unstable, or strong) with 30% of their normal stats and take no damage while that dragon is still alive. When that dragon is killed, gain 20% in all stats for next 3 seconds and attack as many players as possible. Costs 700 mana.\nIt has a total of 700 mana with 25 (and + 1 for every 5 players in the lobby) mana regen per second.\nAdditional Information: Aspect of the Dragons ability spawns a separate \"mini-boss\", which is basically just another dragon (with all the abilities I mentioned earlier) with nerfed stats. During this time, the Superior Dragon is basically immune to everything.\nNormal Superior Dragon seems like the normal ender dragon, so adding these abilities will definitely make it more terrifying, fun, and interesting.\n\n\nThose were all the dragons and my thought on possible abilities they might have.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Baby Dragons\n\n\n\nNow, I was thinking about dragon fights and besides the separate dragon spawning from the Superior Dragon that I mentioned earlier, it's always just one dragon.\nSo what if, during the time when the dragons say \"I call upon my loyal servant for this final battle!\" it spawns not only the buffed zealots and endermen but also baby dragons. Also, all the crystals will respawn.\nNow basically baby dragons will be smaller ender dragons without a real distinction between old, protector, wise, etc. They're just small ender dragons.\nAround 5-10 of them will spawn, there being a higher chance that more of them spawn the better the actual dragon is, so it would be sorta like:\n(around 5 baby dragons) protector --> old --> wise --> unstable --> young --> strong --> superior (around 10 baby dragons), or something along those lines.\nThe baby dragons would have either a set value of health (maybe 1 million, 500k) or a percentage of the original dragon (maybe 30%, 10%, 1%), and the defense, damage, and strength would be the same (always a set amount of damage, so no crit). They would also be pretty fast, maybe the speed of young dragon, slightly slower. They would shoot fireballs (relatively weak but still does damage and knockback) to nearby players, and also \"bite\" them (just normal attacking but named it bite since it sounds like something a dragon would do). These baby dragons would have to be taken out first in order for the original dragon to be damaged. They wouldn't be able to leave the dragon's nest, and they would heal using the end crystals (the crystals will prioritize the baby dragons instead of the original dragon).\nThe stats could be played around with. Again, I don't really know how good they should be, it's up to admins and testers to try out different values and see how buffed they are. So saying \"bruh 1 mil health is too op\" doesn't matter since that can change whenever.\n\n\n\nSome extra ideas that I'm not too sure about:\n\n\nSpoiler: Swords\n\n\n\nSo basically what I thought of was having not only aotd, but also specific swords made for each dragon. Like Old Dragon Sword, Young Dragon Sword, Superior Dragon Sword, etc.\nSo what I thought is that these could be made from rare drops from the dragons. They wouldn't be directly rare drops, but instead they would require some amount of different drops to forge (not craft) them.\nI know that scales will be added for reforging, so I guess I'll go with Dragon Teeth (if you would like, you can easily replace every time I say teeth with scales, it really doesn't matter).\nEach Dragon will drop 0-3 teeth. Old Dragon will drop Old Dragon Teeth, Protector Dragon will drop Protector Dragon Teeth, etc. These would rely on dragon weight, but not too sure on how much you'll need.\nFor each Dragon Sword, you'll need 30 teeth (minimum 10 dragons of the type to be killed). I will get into the specifics of what each sword does later, but first, I will explain how you would forge the Dragon Sword.\nYou would need a forgery, something unlocked at iron collection level X (10). It will look like a normal anvil, except instead of the 3 iron blocks at the top, it will be 15 enchanted iron blocks (5 in each slot). It would also need 20 enchanted iron ingots in the place of the normal iron ingots (5 in each slot). Basically the same thing as normal anvil crafting except each iron block replaced with 5 enchanted iron blocks and each iron ingot replaced with 5 enchanted iron ingots.\nBy the way, the forgery does not look like an anvil and does not have gravity.\nOnce you place the forgery, you will need it to have a lava source block directly underneath it as fuel.\nNow, on this subject I would like to add something.\nEnchanted Lava Buckets can place normal lava, then when picked it, it becomes a normal lava bucket. So my idea is that when you place an enchanted lava bucket, it places a sorta shiny lava (same shine as swords have with enchants). This makes it distinct from normal lava. This enchanted lava will deal much more damage than normal lava (even if you have lava/fire talisman). This won't have any use besides being used for the forgery. If you pick up the enchanted lava again, you still get the enchanted lava bucket, meaning that placing it places enchanted lava and you can pick it right back up.\nSo back to forge. You must place an enchanted lava under the forgery. It will then \"turn on\"/activate and is ready for use. The enchanted lava will disappear too, now inside the forgery.\nIf you right click on the forgery without the enchanted lava underneath (instead a normal block or normal lava), then it will say \"Not Enough Fuel!\" and you won't be able to access the forgery slots, however you will be able to see what the menu looks like.\nNow, I don't really know how to create this sort of menu, but I want it to be something like this:\nIt has one slot near the top middle where you can place your dragon teeth. Below that, it will show a sort of red arrow where as the lava is being used, the arrow's red bar goes down, indicating that your lava is being used and showing you the progress of the forging. Below the arrow, there will be an empty slot where the dragon sword appears and the dragon teeth disappears. If you place, say 34 dragon teeth in the first slot, then after the forge, 4 teeth will remain in that slot. Placing 60 teeth will leave 30 teeth. Also, forging will take some time. Maybe seconds, minutes, hours, days.\nSo now, I will explain how the dragon swords will work.\n\n\nSpoiler: Dragon Swords\n\n\n\nAll of the item abilities use up all of your mana. Most of them would also be different/buffed versions of pre-existing items.\n\n\nSpoiler: Protector Dragon Sword\n\n\n\nThe Protector Dragon Sword will be close to the Aspect of the Dragons in terms of stats.\nIt would have the item ability \"Protector\", which would regenerate your health back to 100%. It's basically a more expensive and powerful wand of healing, which can also be used in battle.\nWith Protector Dragon Armor: Gain 50% more defense and max health.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Old Dragon Sword\n\n\n\nThe Old Dragon Sword will be close to the Aspect of the Dragons in terms of stats, similar to the Protector Dragon Sword.\nIt would have the item ability \"Old\", which would double your intelligence for 10 seconds. It would also boost your health and damage by 3%. It's basically pheonix pet but temporary.\nWith Old Dragon Armor: All enchants are buffed by 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Wise Dragon Sword\n\n\n\nThe Wise Dragon Sword will be slightly better than Aspect of the Dragons.\nIt would have the item ability \"Wise\", which would double your mana and intelligence for 10 seconds. It would fill up your mana completely (once), and all item abilities would cost 33% less (same as Wise Dragon Armor Set Bonus).\nWith Wise Dragon Armor: All abilities cost 50% less mana.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Unstable Dragon Sword\n\n\n\nThe Unstable Dragon Sword will be much better than Aspect of the Dragons and 50 Million Midas.\nIt would have the item ability \"Unstable\", which would strike all mobs within 5 blocks with lightning (no players). This does not apply to bosses.\nWith Unstable Dragon Armor: All hits will strike with additional lightning.\nSpecifications: Those hits only apply when you hit a mob (no players, also bow and fishing rod won't strike lightning). This is basically like lightning rune, but it actually damages them. When you one shot a mob, it will strike in the same way lightning rune does (not damaging anything), and when you don't one shot a mob (say you're hitting a sea emperor), then it will continuously strike, dealing lightning damage. This lightning will not charge creepers, turn pigs into pigmen, or turn villagers into witches.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Young Dragon Sword\n\n\n\nThe Young Dragon Sword will be much better than Aspect of the Dragons and 50 Million Midas.\nIt would have the item ability \"Young\", which would make the player's speed be 300 for 10 seconds.\nWith Young Dragon Armor: You would have a speed cap of 300.\nSpecifications: You would have speed 300 unless you take off the armor and stop using sword for too long. This means you can use bow, grappling hook, etc then switch right back to the sword to maintain your speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Strong Dragon Sword\n\n\n\nThe Strong Dragon Sword will be much much better than Aspect of the Dragons and 50 Million Midas.\nIt would have the item ability \"Strong\", which would buff your strength and damage by 20%.\nWith Strong Dragon Armor: Deal 50% more damage total.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Superior Dragon Sword\n\n\n\nThe Superior Dragon Sword will be much better than Aspect of the Dragons and 50 Million Midas.\nIt would have the item ability \"Superior\", which would buff all of your stats by 10% (includes pet luck, sea creature chance, etc) for next 30 seconds.\nWith Superior Dragon Armor: All stats are buffed by 25%.\n\n\nThese are definitely unbalanced, even seeing it myself. Definitely can be changed, buffed, or nerfed in whatever way fits the game.\n\n\nNow, that was it for dragon swords. You may have thought that that was all the new swords I thought of. No. I thought of a great definite end-game weapon that may be very overpowered.\n\n\nSpoiler: The Ultimate Dragons' Sword\n\n\n\nI have no clue how this would be called.\nAnyway, this won't be crafted with a crafting table. This will require an enchanted crafting table, made with 1 crafting table in the middle and 30 dragon teeth surrounding it. You may be wondering, how are 7 dragon teeth types going to fully surround a crafting table, requiring 8 slots total? Well, they are adding new \"Holy Dragon Fragments\". So when you clear dungeons, along with getting Holy Dragon Fragments when you can, you can also get Holy Dragon Teeth. So with that, 8 dragons total. 30 of each type's teeth around a crafting table (any arrangement) will give an enchanted crafting table. In this, there is only one available crafting recipe. Expensive as heck, but very very powerful.\nThe Ultimate Dragons' Sword can be crafted.\n1 Aspect of the Dragons in the middle. Then, around it, in the 8 slots available, you need one of each type of dragon sword. Old Dragon Sword, Protector Dragon Sword, Wise Dragon Sword, Young Dragon Sword, Unstable Dragon Sword, Strong Dragon Sword, Superior Dragon Sword, and of course, Holy Dragon Sword.\nAll of these combined gives you the Ultimate Dragons' Sword.\nCrafted and forged from hundreds of dragon deaths (probably like over 50 mil from just that), multiple enchanted lava buckets, lots of forging, lots of iron, tons of grinding.\nIt will be better than the aspect of the dragons, better than 50 million midas, heck, even better than maxed out Aspect of the Jerry! It would be the ultimate end game weapon, probably costing hundreds of millions of coins.\nIt would be the ultimate weapon.\nFaQ coming from literally no one: What about ultimate bow or ultimate fishing rod or ultimate armor?\nAnswer: Probably not, I mean it's hard enough to get what I just described. If you need to do that 4 more times for armor just to be completely end game, then I don't think people just have a couple billion coins just lying around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Dragon Flesh\n\n\n\nThis item is a rare drop from all dragons. You can use it as a brewing ingredient to brew Dragon Potions, which increases your damage to dragons.\nThis was suggested by @Trooper828xx btw, credit to him.\n\n\nWell, that was all I came up with.\nI have been working on this post for almost a week and long months of thinking it out too.\nI hope you guys enjoy this or at least think it's a good idea. Please remember that this post is mainly me talking about reworking dragons and making new weapons and concepts out of it, not that we should buff Old Dragon by 10% even though it's better to buff it by 5%. Basically saying that it's the concepts I want to share, not the numbers, since those can be changed easily.\nPlease comment below if there's something you want to add or a mistake you noticed, or if you just want to say you liked it or hated it or whatever.\nI am not asking for creative ratings, but I am saying that the more creative ratings there are, the more likely that it will draw admins' attentions, possibly having one or more of these concepts being adding into the game.\nOnce again, hope you guys enjoyed this, I spent a very long time on this.\nBumps are highly appreciated! Also, all of the concepts above are my original ideas.\nEdit 1: We hit 69 positive reactions on 7/29, thanks guys."}, {"title": "what reforge is good on talismans now ? i want damage", "body": "title"}, {"title": "Any Staff pls help me", "body": "I saw a kid in a lobby said he will build a farm for coins so i payed him 160k he said he wanted 200k i said i will give him the 40k after my minions made money tommrow he said fine then there was a power outage in my area i went offline for like a hour or 2 then he just stole everything \n\nhis ign is _TheSlayer_\nhe will change his ign now i think so i have got chat proof \ni dont have to proof of him spamming in the lobby but u guys can check the logs"}, {"title": "[POLL] When will you quit?", "body": "for me it will be when it becomes p2w"}, {"title": "What lvl should I start f3 in", "body": "Title"}, {"title": "[July 31] Dungeons Items and New Floor Description", "body": "Hello Again,\nToday I am discussing all the new things that was released in the patch.\n\nNew Mobs/Items:\nMINI BOSS - Traveling Avenger: Is wearing Zombie Knight armor and a Bonzo Mask, and has 500k health.

No one denies that. Everyone did know that mage had to be nerfed, but not to this level. It even affects classes like healers because of the mana regen nerfs.\n\nSo, I played a few dungeons runs, and these are my expierences with them.\n\n1. You could tell that you were dealing way less damage. With the Bonzo staff, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but with other magic weapons (like pigman sword) you could really tell the difference.\n\n2. Speaking of the Pigman Sword, it was nerfed all the way down. With a whopping 5 second cooldown, it\u2019s instantly a trash weapon. In fact, the whole purpose of this weapon now is to convert mana into defense. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n3. Mana regen absolutely sucks. Some people can argue about the nerfs to the weapons, but everyone can agree a 90% nerf to mana regen took it way too far. This not only nerfs the mage, but all other classes too when it comes to healing, and even healer. The main point of the healer is to heal, why in the world would they need to attack in order to get mana?\n\n4. Fighting mini bosses like the watcher and bosses like Bonzo were way more tough. Without the \u201cPigman go brrrrrrr\u201d, I had to rely on my Bonzo staff, which was way more annoying because of the knockback. (It was a little more fun though seeing bonzo live for more than 3 seconds)\n\n\nWhat Mages Should Do\n1. Sell your pigman sword, unless you really want defense. Frozen scythe is much better.\n\n2. You can sell your Bonzo staff if you want. Other cheap weapons like the dreadlord sword deal almost as much damage. However, remember you need to deal melee damage to regen mana, and the Bonzo staff is much better for melee damage than the dreadlord sword.\n\n3. Start carrying mana potions with you. With your mana supply constantly running out, mana potions will be vital in a bad scenario.\n\n4. Definitely use Voodoo doll and Yeti sword. They weren\u2019t nerfed, and honestly they\u2019re some of the best mage weapons now.\n\n\nWhat Admins Should Do\n1. Reduce mana regen from 90%, to 50% maximum, and add a passive to the healer that doesn\u2019t reduce your mana regen at all.\n\n2. Reduce the cooldown of the Pigman Sword from 5 seconds, to 2 seconds. Right now, the pigman sword has become useless yet again, and something needs to be done about it. Reducing the cooldown to 2 seconds will at the very least make it useable, instead of trash.\n\n3. Instead of nerfing a single class really hard, nerf that class by a little bit, and buff all other classes. As you could tell, f4 is absurdly difficult, and the only way to combat that is to buff other classes. The better option in this scenario would be to nerf mage (obviously), but buff berserker, tank, archer, and healer. This in turn makes a more enjoyable experience for everyone, and will make the classes more balanced, instead of throwing one class into a garbage bin.\n\n\nEDIT: I am not saying that mages shouldn\u2019t have been nerfed, i am saying that the admins nerfed mage too much, and one of these nerfs impacted other classes as well."}, {"title": "Best way to get combat XP?", "body": "I am a relatively new player, I have a max enchanted AOTE and need to level my combat XP more so I can start using stronger weapons I have\n\nDoes anyone have any good ways to farm combat XP?\nI would like to stay out of the end because my gear is not strong enough to kill anything but the basic 4.5k hp endermen.

Please don\u2019t comment if you haven\u2019t read this to avoid confusion. \n\nSo I\u2019ve noticed obviously through playing skyblock that nons are discriminated against. First I\u2019m going to explain why this is wrong, and then I\u2019ll explain why it happens.\n\nThe non stereotype are lapis or ender armor players. They hit your Tara boss with a knockback or fire aspect sword. They try to steal your jerry gifts. They beg for money and free stuff in hub. They complain and whine. Sounds like a little kid right? That\u2019s because THEY ARE!\n\nMost of the people that play skyblock are kids around the ages 10-14. If you\u2019re older than that u can remember when u were that age. U were immature and lazy. No offense to 13 year olds, but your mind isn\u2019t developed yet. Ur not dumb, but u don\u2019t hav enough experience to know how to succeed in a game like this. It\u2019s easy to make money in skyblock but you\u2019re too lazy to do it and u can\u2019t figure out how to do it. Thats why nons beg for stuff. It\u2019s because they can\u2019t figure out the game.\n\nBut it\u2019s not right to discriminate against them. Not all nons are \u201cnons\u201d. Most nons are little kids cuz they dont have a debit card to buy themselves a rank and their parents won\u2019t do it for them. But you\u2019re forgetting all those people who are mature and are good at the game but they choose not to buy a rank cuz they don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. They don\u2019t deserve the discrimination. Don\u2019t hate on them for their rank just cuz of all the annoying little kids.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about why people hate nons and target them. Obviously they\u2019re annoying, but I for one hav never lashed out at one. Sometimes I\u2019ll get annoyed and tell them to leave but I don\u2019t throw hate. Anyone who is mature knows that throwing hate doesn\u2019t do anything. And guess what, a lot of those people that are throwing hate? They\u2019re 13-15 years old too. These are the people that do have a rank. They either had their parents buy it for them or used their debit card. And because they have a rank they think they\u2019re so much better than nons. They attack them and rub it in their face. It makes them feel high and mighty by putting others down. That\u2019s fucked up, and if you do that then you\u2019re the real non. Non isn\u2019t just \u201cno-rank\u201d, it\u2019s the way you act. That\u2019s why people call VIP green non and mvp blue non. It doesn\u2019t matter what ur rank is, if ur gonna be an immature toxic little kid you\u2019re still a non.\n\nInstead of judging people by their rank we should judge them by the amount of work they put into their game. I don\u2019t care if a kid is 9 years old if he has enderdrag full sup and a maxed 50m Midas I respect him. He put in the work to get those things and despite being young and immature was able to succeed. Even if you\u2019re MVP++, if you hav a 10 skill average I would rather coop with a non that has a 25 skill average.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong ranks are amazing and I think it\u2019s good they exist, but judging people for them isn\u2019t right.\n\nI\u2019ll bet $100 that all the negative and toxic comments posted in the comments are kids younger than 15. Part of the reason a lot of people quit skyblock is because of the toxic kids that dramatize this game.

This is extremely beneficial as, as long as you have a high amount of intel, you end up with enough mana to constantly spam it. This means that you can use your ability MORE than you did before the mage nerf, as long as you consistently hit your mage staff passive. Simply put the nerf didn't make mage worthless, it just made it require a lot more skill.\n\nHope you find this post Helpful!"}, {"title": "Unlucky or Lucky?", "body": "i got a fly swatter at 10k exp"}, {"title": "The ICE CREAM MAN ANIMAL + SKYBLOCK", "body": "So some say deep inside the snow minions lives an ICE CREAM MAN ANIMAL these rare exotic beings are only seen when someone has more than a year to live.

Yep, only 150 xp per run, when you could be getting 400 or even 800+ xp from current higher floors.\n\nThis brings a problem. People have to grind low floors again to become a level that gets accepted to higher floors,but this level is increasing overtime, because the higher floors (future ones) will grant much higher amount of XP making it really hard and grindy to catch up to the meta. After all 10 floors will be out (if they'll ever be.. xd) some players will run into a problem of not being able to find a party for specific floor (for example, f4), because most of the playerbase will be already at a much higher level (for example, floors 7 - 10). This player will be slowed down by this, get bored and eventually quit.\n\nThis is a problem that happens in most of team based grinding games, but there is 1 option to prevent this a bit, atleast for the people who just want to switch their class. While joining party, don't show only their class level, but also their catacomb level, because class levels grant only small buffs, meanwhile catacomb level upgrades your gear stats by a huge amount.\n\nIf you read all of this thanks for your time lol\n\nTLDR:\nWhen people switch class, they have problem to find a decent random party for the floor they were previously doing.\nThis problem will become bigger as more floors get implemented into the game.\nOne thing that would help to solve this problem a bit is to show not only people's class level, but also their catacomb level."}, {"title": "What Catacombs Level does it require for Frozen Scythe?", "body": "When you use ice essence what is the catacombs level require"}, {"title": "Combine my Heroic Bonzo's Staff with Ultimate Wise 1, get anvil use 1", "body": "I tried combine my Clean Bonzo's Staff (no enchantments) with Ultimate Wise I, after I combine, my Staff get anvil use 1"}, {"title": "so frozen scythe is the best now?", "body": "?"}, {"title": "Is it worth investing into e lapis blocks?", "body": "This might sound stupid but since the spirit spectre requires six e lapis blocks to craft it would it be a good/bad idea to invest into e lapis blocks?"}, {"title": "SIN (sell it now) Enhanced Version", "body": "Well im sure that this idea is already out there, so i would like to make some modifications regarding to that.

I got my first set of full lapis armor, and got to work starting to enchant it with prot 5 and growth 5. Prot was easy,but the real challenge came in from growth. I started bidding on the AH, but all the rich men stole my books at the last second. So I decided to level my dark oak collection. I got a jungle axe, and began murdering wood. A day later, I had my growth recipe. But I thought to myself, \"how can I take this further?\"and after looking at the growth armor set, and learning it was a subtle flex armor because people wanted to make actual money with clay minions instead of dark oak, I decided to become the #1 Dark Oak Farmer in skyblock.

Well for starters, it has a much lower mana cost than bonzo staff (even bonzo staff with ultimate wise 5 still costs a bit more mana than dreadlord sword WITHOUT ultimate wise 5). Putting ultimate wise 5 on a dreadlord sword drops its mana cost to 20 mana, cheaper than you can get with frozen scythe.\n\nThe best part about it is that it's MUCH easier to obtain than the bonzo staff and frozen scythe. It comes as a rare drop from killing dreadlords in dungeons which spawns on any floor pretty much commonly. It's ability is pretty much spammable like frozen scythe and bonzo staff. If you sword swap after using the dreadlord ability you deal much more damage. \n\nSo yeah moral of the story is. Dreadlord sword is insanely good and I highly suggest picking one up for yourself!

Lately I had been noticing some weird things happening on my account. I am not sure when, but I started spawning in places I didn't recall logging out in, for example a skywars hub. Then I noticed that my chat language had been converted to Chinese. I just thought it might be hypixel glitching out and didn't think much of it. The reason I thought it wasn't a big deal was because I haven't exposed my account information anywhere.\n\nAnyways, today I was playing some Modern Warfare and my friend who I play skyblock with messaged me on discord asking if I had taken our super compactor 5000s out of our minions. I obviously hadn't since I had been playing cod all day. Turns out my account had been online 5 hours previous and went ahead and took our 6 super compactor 5000s out of our minions, our enchanted lava bucket, and withdrew 500k+ out of our bank. (I checked the bank logs and it showed my account withdrawing our entire balance 5 hours ago)\n\nMy friend and I have been grinding for these super compactors and its really frustrating to see all of our stuff stolen.\nWe don't need our items back, I know that isn't possible. We just want to know who my account gave our balance to so that we can track down the account that stole our stuff. If that's not possible, that's fine. We just want to get these hackers banned. I changed my password so hopefully my account is completely gone. I'm MVP and I'd hate to lose everything I've put into this server. If anyone else has similar experiences, I'd love some input on what I can do to keep my account secure in the future.\n\nEdit: I also hope that my account isn't banned for hacking. I know a hacked account isn't an acceptable excuse but to be caught up in a ban wave on top of losing all my stuff would suck.

I mean with 1200 defense, you become nearly invincible. It is 3 times better than the Hardened Diamond Armor and provides 2 times the defense of Dragon Armor. Although this Armor has no abilities, it's insane amount of defense makes up for it.\n\nWise Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp ) - For me this is the best Dragon set. All abilities cost 50% less mana. You can basically become unkillable if you have a Zombie Sword with you. Rogue Sword and AOTE is also very fun and useful while wearing this armor.\n\nSuperior Dragon Armor ( 600 def, 450 hp ) - This armor boosts all your stats by five percent. AOTD ability also deals 50 percent more damage which means that it's ability will now do more than a thousand damage. For me this is the 2nd best Dragon set.\n\n\nStrong Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp) - With this full set on you gain 100 more strength, which increases your base damage by a lot. This set also buffs AOTE by a little. If you want to deal lots of damage, then use this set.\n\nUnstable Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp) - Increase your crit chance and damage by a ton, which is very good because you have a better chance to one or two shot Zealots and other End mobs. The lighting ability is also pretty decent too.\n\nProtector Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp) - This set is focused on defense. It also increases your defense when you are low which is really good. The lower you are the more defense you get.\n\nOld Dragon Armor ( 520 def, 650 hp ) - This set has no cool abilities, but it gives a lot of health and defense which is really awesome. It is not that great compared to other Dragon sets but I still think this set is an A tier.\n\nEmerald Armor ( 570 def, 300 hp ) - This used to be the best armor in the game, but now it is outclassed by Perfect Armor and Dragon Armor. It is still a pretty decent End game Armor though.\n\nDiver Armor( 500 def, 290 hp) - Super rare to get because you need to fish a LOT, which takes a crap ton of patience but it has really good stats. When you swim underwater you become aquaman. However, it is still outclassed by other end game armours.\n\nBlaze Armour( 410 def ) - An amazing armour. The recent update removes fire prot from the Armour which means that you can now put prot on it. With the full set on you gain 40 strength, 8 percent speed and immunity to fire and lava. Mobs will also take damage when you are near them. This armour is about as expensive as Speedster Armour but I think it's worth it.\n\n\nB\n\nEnder Armour( 170 def, 90 hp ) - This armour is only good in the end as it doubles all stats, including reforges. It is a pain to get this armour though, as Enderman rarely drop these. Outside of the end it is pretty useless.\n\nYoung Dragon Armor( 500 def, 350 hp) - Worst Dragon set. It is basically like speedster armor but with more health and defense. You gain 70% WALK speed when only you are at FULL health. You can just use rogue sword and it will still be faster. This is a good set but it is the worst Dragon set.\n\nSpeedster Armour (350 def) - It is like hardened diamond armor but with 20 more defense and a lot more speed. It is a very good mid game Armor and not that hard to get. Just build a huge sugar cane farm and you will be surprised how easy it is to get that armour.\n\nMonster Hunter( 235 def, 220 hp) - It has pretty decent defense and hp, but what makes this armour so good is the fact that there are four abilities in this armour. You also deal 25% more damage to mobs and take less damage from mobs. Pretty good mid game Armor.\n\nHardened Diamond( 330 def) - This is one of the best early to mid game armours. It provides good defense which is good as you will now not get one or two shotted by the obsidian sanctuary mobs. It is also very easy to get and craft.\n\nGolem Armour (250 def, 105 hp ) - This is a good early game armour, but I still think it's not worth the time to get this armor as it so expensive. It's stats is equally matched to Hardened Diamond so I recommend going for Hardened Diamond as it is much easier.\n\nSponge Armour( 285 def) - Relatively easy to craft, it has high defense and when in water, the defense is that of an Emerald Armour! Although on land it is outclassed by many mid game armours.\n\nZombie Armour( 60 def, 530 hp) - Similar to the Magma Armour, it has low def and high hp. But what makes this armour B tier is that you regenerate health two times faster and also regenerate health when hit by a projectile. However this armour is SUPER expensive to craft.\n\nC\n\nEmber Armour( 180 def, 200 hp ) - Honestly this armour is not that good. It provides less defense than golem and Hardened Diamond. The full set ability is also not that good. You could just use fire or lava talisman instead. \n\nMagma Armour( 85 def, 470 hp ) - This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think Magma Armour is not that good. Sure it has super high health and intelligence but look at its defense..... ITS ABYSMAL. If you go to the end with this armour you would probably get one or two shotted. Heck, you would probably have a hard time against the Obsidian Sanctuary mobs.\n\nMiner Armour( 375 def in mines ) - In mines it is very good and it's regen ability is super broken, but outside of the mines it is probably one of the worst Armour in Skyblock.\n\nArmour of Growth( 145 def, 380 hp) - Pretty decent def and hp. This armour also has good healing abilities as well. But you need to get like 5000000000 dark oak wood....... so it's not worth it for me.\n\nLapis Armour( 120 def, 60 hp) - Great set for early game. It gives 200% more experience when mining ores which is very useful. However it's stats are low so you would probably get two shotted by the Obsidian Sanctuary mobs.\n\nMiner's Outfit ( 100 def ) - Absolutely must have when you are trying to grind cobblestone as it gives haste two which will insta break it. Not useful in combat.\n\n\nD\n\nCrystal Armour (100 def ) - The base defense is trash, even worse than Lapis Armor. You also need to rely on the freaking light level in order to make it slightly better. This armour is a complete joke.\n\nAngler Armour( 80 def, 165 hp ) - This is mainly used for fishing but....... with that defense you would get bodied by sea monsters. It did not even show statistics it just says it increases the spawn rate of sea creatures and reduces damage, but how much? If you want to increase sea creatures spawn rate then there are billions of ways you can do it in skyblock. \n\nDiamond Armour( 100 def ) - With that Armour set on you would absolutely get destroyed by even lapis zombies. It is a good starter Armour though because you can wear it and grind lapis zombies until you get lapis Armour.\n\nFairy Armour( 4 def, 4 hp ) - Sure you get speed but...... the defense is in the same level as leather Armour. Also you get -4 intelligence. Brilliant."}, {"title": "The mage does *not* need to be reverted", "body": "As a mage, I originally thought that these changes sucked and wanted to chuck my computer out the window.\nBut after actually playing and trying out the new system, it isn't actually too bad.\n\nThe reason people feel like mage needs to be reverted is because it does so much less damage than before, but still does just as easily, if not even easier because you can't regen the mana to put down the flux + wand + zombie sword anymore without engaging in combat. However, this is not the main issue.\n\nThe main issue right now is the agro system. As a mage, you'll be playing the game as intended if you stay behind the tank and attack large swarms of troops *from range* whilst the tank takes the hits which would have 2-3 shot you. But currently, the troops do not always target the tank.\nEven with the tank using their ultimate ability, which is supposed to agro *all* mobs in a 10 block radius, the mobs can still go and attack the archers/mages who rely on the damage absorption from the tank. Jingle bells does shockingly bad at agroing mobs too. This system needs to be fixed.\n\nThe reason why no one noticed this flaw before is that haha pigman sword went brrrrrrrr and handed you a ridiculous amount of defense, rendering you unkillable and you would take out the mobs before they even had a chance to deal any meaningful damage to you.\n\nTL,Dr: The mage is fine as is, it's the agroing system which needs to be fixed so tanks can actually do their job and protect the weaker \"glass cannons\"."}, {"title": "Is dh5 glitch or somethin coz with multiple hits no dmg like 200k....", "body": "im trying to figure out wut im doing wrong pls help"}, {"title": "New minion ideas and stuff", "body": "#1.

If there's something you don't agree with, share your opinion. This shouldn't be taken that seriously tho\n\nSo, when I woke up, I saw the patch notes and I see they nerfed mage...\nBravo Hypixel...\n\nJokes aside, this is how I'd change the classes\n\nBerserker is considered as the worst class by many. Let's change that :\n1 - Berserkers will get an extra defense bonus, like 1/4 of a tank's buff\n2 - As a tradeoff, berserker speed gain will be halved. This will make the berserker class a Mighty Glacier : Good def and attack, but mediocre speed.\n\nArcher is the wackiest class : Some consider it the worst, some say it's good.\nLet's buff it anyway : Archer's projectiles have a bigger hitbox and they deal more damage the further an enemy is. To top it all off, we can add the \"Sniper Duel\" achievement from vanilla minecraft, but instead of being against every skeleton, it will be given if you kill a sniper from 50 blocks away.\nThat way, the archer is better as a zoner.\n\nTank is, in my opinion, the most balanced class : A stone wall.\nThe only change I'm doing to it is that enemies will prioritize the classes as followed :\nTank and Berserker > Mage and Healer > Archer\n\nHealer is good, I don't see buffs/nerfs for these.\n\nMage was nerfed the wrong way imo. Let's start doing the changes :\n1 - All the nerfs made to mage are reverted\n2 - Their mana regen is also reverted\n3 - Their defense is 1/4 from usual. This way the mage is a real glass cannon.\n4 (Edit) - Bonzo Staff will be changed to 750 base damage and 3.3 x 10^(-1) mana scale (0.33). This will be something in between pre and post nerf\n\nIn general, the mana regen is going to be 80% for every other class. Also, if there's 3+ people with the same class, those ppl will get their dungeon buffs and XP gained debuffed :\n3 -> 0.9x of the dungeon buffs\n4 -> 0.8x\n5 -> 0.75x\n\nFor more info about archetypes, check out this vid.

I was actually wrong, but it\u2019s not black and white. \n\nPros:\n\n-allow you to outcompete others for various things like zealots or dark oak\n-speeds up slayers because the jump boost and speed lets you kill more enemies faster, also the combat xp boost helps with spawning and the crit and strength help with killing the boss fast\n-is cheap compared to the price of mats. It can cost up to 5 million coins to brew all of the potions because of red stone lamps. \n-makes you feel like a god, it\u2019s so fun\n\nCons:\n-while rich people can be arrogant and brag about how 100k is nothing to them, it can add up. Over the course of your skyblock game u could spend 10m or more on godsplashes. \n-if you disconnect from the server or die you lose all your effects\n-not all potions are helpful depending on the task\n\n\nI honestly think that people use godsplashes way too much. There are many things you don\u2019t need a godsplash for and it\u2019s just overkill. Sorry guys but you don\u2019t need a godsplash to grind wood in the park, brewing the pots you need yourself is cheaper. \n\nBut on the other hand there are things that are almost necessary to have a splash for. I recently grinded to Tara 7 and without a godsplash it would hav taken 3 or 4 times as long. The speed allowed me to outcompete other people and the jump boost was probably the best, allowed me to kill more spiders faster. The crit and strength gave me way more damage so I could kill them quickly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever grind slayers without a splash again. \n\nZealot grinding is eh, a godsplash will definitely help you outcompete others but I\u2019ve never used it for that, I\u2019ve never even grinded zealots in public lobbies because it\u2019s too slow. I wait to get a private one and then get 8 eyes in an hour. \n\nGod splashes are definitely worth it for several things, but they aren\u2019t required for everything u do in the game. My personal recommendation would be to only use them for slayers and zealots. \n\nI don\u2019t want all the drama I got in the last post about how I\u2019m wrong and all this stuff, this is just my opinion from using splashes and playing the game.

I only recently started actually playing the game legit. I have been a solo account for basically all 10 months, albeit a 5 minute period with a guild member when I wanted to test /coop. I know this is kinda sad, but in the 10 months of on and off playing, I have 24 minion slots, young dragon armor, and raiders axe with only 2 mil in my bank account. As you can see, I am not the most grindy person in the world, but I enjoy playing it when I have time.\n\nAbout a week or two ago, I logged on to see that my profile that I had been slowly working on for months had been wiped randomly. From what I know, there are only a few reasons where you can get wiped without receiving a ban of any sorts. First reason is being a buyer in irl trading. There isn't really a way to prove I never have done it, but if you just look at my profile, its pretty clear to me at least that I am the least likely person to irl trade. First off, I have been playing for 10 months with very little to show for it. Second, I literally have no money, no op gear, nothing. Another reason for my wipe could be profile boosting. I only have that 1 profile, so I can't profile boost myself. I barely ever trade with anyone so I doubt I was mistaken for a profile booster or whatever. And the third reason, and last I can think of, is my 5 minute coop got banned or wiped, which ruined me. If I was wiped for a 5 minute coop, that stupid, and what I know, my coop member was not banned or wiped in this recent wave.\n\nSupport and my complaint:\nI contacted support to see if my wipe could be appealed as well as asking them the reason for my wipe. First, they responded kindly telling me they would investigate the reason for my wipe and see if my coop was banned or anything. But after that initial review, they responded with\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\nLosing your profile for unknown reasons is a very big indicator that your account may have been compromised.\n\nPlease re-secure your account using this guide here: https://hypixel.net/threads/guide-compromised-account-and-account-security-alert-bans.254944/\n\nSadly, we cannot restore any lost items, stats, progress, or give back coins. SkyBlock is currently a prototype gamemode, which means that it is under heavy development at all times.\n\nIf you have any further questions or issues that we can help you with, feel free to reply here or create another ticket!\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\nNow here is my complaint. I get that wipes are necessary to prevent economies being broken and everything, but what I don't understand is how even during this recent wipe wave, where I see tons of people complaining about false wipes and never being unwiped after the forum post explaining the recent wave, you don't see any reason to change your policy over when people can be restored. And I don't understand why even after an investigation where it seems there is zero reason for a wipe, you can just brush it off and blame it on a very slight chance that after 3 years of having Minecraft with no problem, my Minecraft account was compromised. IMO, its disgusting how you can totally disregard a wipe of a player who has played for 10 months without a single infraction in any game mode and make excuses for a wipe without any reason. I know this thread will probably do nothing, but Hypixel, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, change your system and make it so people can appeal wipes.\n\nFinally, Thank you for a fun 10 months.

Pigman Sword:\nComparison of pre-nerf and post-nerf Pigman:\nPigman (Pre-nerf)\nNo cooldown, 150 mana cost, +50 defense on ability use and 7500 base damage.\nPigman (Post-nerf)\nPigman Sword now has a 5 second cooldown and costs 400 mana, has 300 intel, grants 200 defense has 30000 base damage.\nI think the cooldown part hurt Pigman the most. As a DPS sword which should deal a lot of magic damage, it does not deserve to be treated like this. The main flaw I see in Pigman is its defense buffing, as it allows mage to suddenly transfrom into a tank when spammed well. What I suggest here would solve the problem of defense stacking with Pigman.\nPigman (Suggested Change)\nCooldown reduced to 0.5s, costs 225 mana, has 0 intel, grants 0 defense on ability use and 5000 base damage.\nAlternate:\nCooldown reduced to 0s, costs 225 mana, 0 intel, decreases defense by 10 on ability use, 6500 base damage.\nThis would make Pigman a real high-risk high-reward sword, and would fit the role of Mage's glass cannon role.\n\n2. Bonzo's Staff:\nBonzo's Staff got nerfed to the ground in this update. Its magic scaling got nerfed to x0.2 damage, and that impacted a lot using Bonzo Staff.\nTo analyse how the situation could be solved, we should look at most people using Bonzo's Staff. The people using Bonzo's Staff are usually mid-game players who are not rich enough to afford the better gear of Mage, and they can be distinguished as they are usually in Wise Dragon Armor.\nTo help these mid-game players but not affect Frozen Scythe, I propose the following:\nBonzo's Staff (Suggested Change)\nAbility damage nerfed back to 500, magic scaling x0.6, balloons explode when they travel more than 7 blocks or hit a mob. Ability cost: 100 -> 125\nThis would allow some space for the mid-game players to use, and transforms Bonzo Staff from an long-range AOE cleaner to a short-distance AOE cleaner. This effectively seperates it from Frozen Scythe as AOE Cleaners, giving them different roles. It also effectively solves the problem of people using Bonzo's Staff to snipe adventurers by implementing a range of the balloons..\n\nOther changes I think are good:\nFrozen Scythe: Scaling 0.3x -> 0.55x, ability damage 500 -> 650\nJust buff this. It's been nerfed too many times and it should be better than Bonzo's Staff.\nLeaping Sword: Scaling 1x -> 0.6x\nDon't let the stun machine do a lot of damage. Even though damage done now is small (~4k), I still think the admins should make this sword deal less damage.\nYeti Sword: Range decreased to 24 blocks in Dungeons, scaling from 1x -> 0.7x, scaling reduced to 1x -> 0.5x when hit target is 16+blocks away from the caster.\nSelf-explanatory. Yeti Sword could hit a very long distance and deal a lot of damage in Dungeons, thus it should probably be nerfed.\nAspect of the Dragons: Cooldown of 1.5s, scaling from 1x->0.6x in Dungeons\nAOTD definitely has to have a cooldown. It just knocks mobs away from you, thus making you practically invulnerable when they can't hit you. It also deals a lot of damage to mobs.\nVoodoo Doll: Cooldown of 13s, scaling from 1x->0.7x in Dungeons\nVoodoo Doll is somewhat similar to Yeti Sword, which dealt a lot of damage. Decreasing the magic scaling and increasing the cooldown (so you can't infinitely stack the ability) sounds like a good choice to me.\n\nIf you have any opinions on these, please tell me by replying.\nIf you think this was a good thread nevertheless, please bump it (and tell me how to improve)!\nHope this made sense to you all! Thanks for reading!\nTL;DR: read the post you lazy non"}, {"title": "SNOW is actually NOT THE BEST minion for mining XP or MONEY!", "body": "Alright, so to start off, I'll have to explain how snow minions make XP. They do so mainly through diamond spreading (About 80-90% or so).\n\nDiamond spreading, for those who don't know, gives a 10% chance to spontaneously generate a diamond for every item generated by a minion (Diamond spreading, sadly, does not have the ability to generate a diamond off of the diamond it previously generated).\n\nBecause snow minions produce 4 snow per break, they can generate up to 4 diamonds at a time at a 10% chance each. Overall, each day, a snow minion can produce 26,584 snowballs. 10% of that is 2658.4 diamonds/day. (Source: https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Snow_Minion)\n\nBased on what was laid out there, the best minions for mining XP are ones that fit this set of criteria:\n\n1. It has to have a low time-per-action (TPA)\n\n2. It has to produce a lot of items per action. (IPA)\n\n3. The minion itself has to get the items, so no AFK falling pits with tarantula minions or other combat minions.\n\nBased on those criteria, snow has a TPA of 6.5s (x2 because it has to place as well as break, so 13s), and has an IPA of 4. Snow cannot be AFK'ed, so it fits criteria 3 no matter what.\nPretty good, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nMelon minions have a TPA of 13s (improved by Farm Crystals to 11.7), and an IPA of ~5. Melon CAN be AFK'ed, but it does so in a way that fits criteria 3. In other words, Melon minions produce more items per action faster than snow (but only when you're AFK). The method is really simple, too: you literally just AFK on your island because melon minions produce stalks which generate the melons passively, as opposed to placing the melons themselves. That's right- you literally need no AFK setup for it other than just your basic everyday AFK pool.\n\nLooking at the numbers, melon minions when not AFK produce 29,907 melon slices per day. (Source: https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Melon_Minion)\n\nSnow minions produce 26,584. Melon minions produce 12.5% more slices per day than snow minions produce snowballs, and that's not even when AFK or with a farm crystal. That's 12.5% more diamonds, which is 12.5% more mining XP. Of course, snow itself produces about 15% of the mining XP that it gives, so as it currently stands, with no boosts, snow is winning by 2.5%. Okay then, snow is better? What now?\n\nNow, add in a farm crystal and AFK'ing. Melon just got boosted by 120%. (100% from AFK and 10% from farm crystal, doubled because it's a multiplicative boost). Add in an enchanted lava bucket and you have a whopping 175% overall boost (2*1.1*1.25). That's almost Catalyst-tier, and you don't even have to spend more than the one time payment for the minion, super compactor, farm crystal, and enchanted lava bucket. If it actually DID have Catalysts, it would be making melons and diamonds at a 560% overall boost. It's ridiculous. Now Melon is winning by 272.5%, and if both had Catalysts it would be winning by 252.5%.\n\nThat's not to mention the amount of space you can save with Melon minions- they act kind of like diamonds, in a way, because they enchant themselves twice with a super compactor, so it takes 160*160*64 (1,638,400) to fill up one slot with enchanted melon blocks. Snow, however, takes 10 slots to compact once (Enchanted snow takes 160 snow blocks, which is 640 snow, or 64*10 which is 10 stacks) and can't even do so twice. 640*64 (40,960) is the amount needed to fill up one slot with enchanted snow blocks, and it needs 10 stacks to even compact. In total, a T11 minion with a large storage has a total of 30 slots to work with, no matter what minion it is. Diamond spreading takes up a total of 6 slots, enchanted diamonds (up to 159 before compacting, or 3 slots), and regular diamonds (also up to 159, 3 slots). Enchanted snow takes up a total of 10 slots with just snowballs. The \"working number\" therefore, is 16 slots not filled with either enchanted snow or enchanted diamond blocks. That leaves a total of 14 slots for either enchanted diamond blocks or enchanted snow.\n\nWere the slots to be filled completely with enchanted snow, it would take 573,440 items to do so. Melon would have barely gotten 24 enchanted melon blocks in that time, and would still have 15 slots left. Your snow minions are safe for (573,440/(26,584*1.1)) days, almost 3 weeks (19 days) without collecting them (The 1.1 is for the diamond spreading). Your melon minions are safe for (1638400*16/(29,907*1.1)) days (796, over TWO YEARS) without filling up. Of course, that's without the bonuses, but even with a 560% max boost it would still take about 20 weeks (142 days, about 5 months) for it to fill up.\n\nMelon minions also give farming XP too, so that's OP.\n\nAlso, with only some of the buffs, Melon minions give more $ than snow. Even more OP.\n\nTL;DR Melon minions are > snow minions for mining XP, $, and farming XP, and you can set them and forget them for months safely if you plan on being away for a while.\n\nYes I put \"SNOW NOT THE BEST\" in all caps in the title so that people would see that first."}, {"title": "What is the best tank set for f4", "body": "What is the best tank set for f4"}, {"title": "Discord", "body": "can i advertise my giveaway discord server in a forum post?"}, {"title": "Hypixel SkyBlock Changes are Meh in My Opinion", "body": "Personally I feel that the the new changes to Hypixel SkyBlock and Dungeons don't seem very nice. I'm going to deny the fact that I personally am not the best at SkyBlock which is a factor that may change my point of view which it most likely will. I mainly don't feel good about the changes to mage builds and abilities as damage for some weapons may have been buffed but the scaling as been nerffed to the point to where for a random non like me, it will actually half the damage of certain mage based weapons.\n\nThe \"nerf\" to the bonzo staff may benefit others with higher intelligence as the scaling difference may not affect them as much and the damage buff may actually increase the damage of some. For me it literally halves the damage I deal which makes it a lot harder for me to progress through dungeons as I'm a broke boi with no intelligence. Now I'm not saying to change the whole scaling system because some dumbass post a thread being like PLeAsE INcReAsE DaMagE pLZ hYPiXeL but maybe change it a bit to fit smaller players which takes up most of the community on Hpixel SkyBlock and nerf it by around 30 or 25% instead of 50%. Yes this may buff the richer players even further but at least it's still a nerf.\n\n\nThis is a weapon (Frozen Scythe I don't think the spoiler worked :/) I'm not the most familiar with but I can definitely say that a nerf was needed but not this hard. Again, they did buff it's damage but the scaling isn't the best. They nerffed it to the point to where it does the same damage as the Bonzo Staff even though it is around 2 times as expensive, in fact it used to 24 million making it almost 5 times as expensive as the price of Bonzo Staff today. The nerf was basically the same as the Bonzo Staff nerf but previous nerfs have made it even worse for more poor players such as myself :/. This effectively over halved the cost of its's worth.\n\n\nAnyways if anyone comes across this I'm sorry for me being annoying AF as I'm some random non no one cares about and this is my first post so I don't even know if the SPOILERS WORK. Anyways some dumbass, annyoing and all-around bad person of a random non heading out.

It's one thing to counter them by introducing some enemies with resistance or immunity to damage like wolf slayer mana damage shouldn't have to scale with intel but ability cost and cooldown timers this was the mistake made. This also shows a current issue with slayer being the flux orbs needed for most classes not being able to be easily gotten by mage class.\n\nBuff all weapons base damage introduces cooldowns to ones with high damage and spam weapons as mage main tool when cooldowns are long to make mages balanced. This is how DND balances classes and exist for a reason. The point of mana pools is to allow for higher damage spells or a larger variety of spells to be used back to back this is something Hypixel is doing poorly.\n\nThe issue was never 100% damage it was being able to be spammed to fast, to high damage, to low spell cost, the choice damage to nerf which is fine but seems as though they did it a bit too harsh in my opinion unless an item is introduced to balance it or scaled back up so Bonzo staff could 2 shot enemies vs the 3 or 4 it does now on floor 2 if the issue was how easily this item was to obtain likewise armor was they could have made it harder to get I'm fine with the weapon being behind fs for this reason but even frozen staff is suffering a bit too much from this update.\n\nMy biggest issue with the last update\nother than damage structure is this:\n\n\"\nMana Regen will now be nerfed by 90% inside Dungeons, however, players gain back mana when hitting enemy monsters.\nEvery hit on an enemy mob gives back 5 mana + 1% of your total mana. (This is the first draft and we will most likely tweak those values over the next few days based on testing and feedback.)\nThis works on all melee attacks, arrow hits, and mage beams (ranged attacks).\nUsing abilities should now require a bit more strategy, let us know what you think about those changes!\n\"\n\nThis was and is a really dumb way to \"FIX\" mages as mages in nature aren't melee and low HP this was a very poor design choice unless you make it so even magic attack hits like Bonzo balloons regen mana to make players stop spamming skills and only use abilities when needed this makes no science at all\n\nI can get behind risked reward but this isn't the way to do it and the would have to reward mana regen based on damage done not by the number of hits.\n\nAll classes should be equally viable the best tests for this are simply designing encounters you want to make each class specialize in \n\nHow classes Should work\nExamples:\n\nBezerker: High damage close range fighter relatively tanky but no so much where he could handle large forms of enemies\n\nTank: decent damage Insanely high hp\n\nArcher: High damage range charter with low hp SLOW attack speed:\n\nMage: Medium damage range charter specializes in quick AOE damage to clear large areas.\n\n\nHealer/Support: provides an essential role by making sure everyone could stay alive low damage, eminence heals (or faster mana regen? or even damage buffs?) to the player who needs them.\n\nMy ideal on how Support would work\nNOTE: My ideal would be to provide the small effect of each to all classes except to their main role skill ie mage gets more mana, tanks more hp, berzerker smaller increases in both damage and hp, higher damage for archer when standing in a circle. with support being able to maximize boost by changing from single target to multi-target boost making situations where it might be more ideal to provide a single player with a boost in certain situations. Rooms with too many enemies boost the mage to quickly clear out the room, to high damage boost the tank or take it while the rest of the team takes him out. to high hp boss buff archer as he has the highest damage, not the berzerker, need a max of damage with a bit more tank (Hardest one to design but possible), buff the berzerker.\n\nHow to measure classes\nThe biggest issue is each class can use any weapon or tool so make it when they use a tool type designed for their class they get bonuses of that type and upscale enemies based off of these bonuses assuming otherwise all player have the exact weapons with varying amount of mana, hp, defense, and damage based off of current best possible stats of each armor type before entering dungeons. Make gear of each type dropable and slightly better on each increasing floor with the need to max it to be ready for the next floor to keep players grinding.\n\nClosing statement\nThese changes are recommended based on dungeons, not core gameplay\nThat is a different can of worms in which mobs AI and stats would have to be changed like maybe make a slayer each class excels at with the best gear for that class put in it but leave general mobs for everyone to excel at the biggest issue would be dragons to fix this issue with unless you like the idea that a dragon might be able to spawn mobs with different effects and stats for each class to take on to protect archers, while archers take down the dragon and rewards being divided up based on a new contribution score in which these mobs can affect and rewards to be based on such.\n\n Don't need to read the rest\nI hope an Admin sees this and adds some changes or get some balancing ideals from this to implement the only thing I would request is an acknowledgment of this thread and post.\n\nAlso if anyone wants to help me reorganize this post to make it more readable and easy to understand feel free to edit this and reply with an edited version with REVISED at the top and I will edit this and credit you for doing so if I think it is an improve=ment of what I have written."}, {"title": "Why the hell do I need a party of 4/5 to play even the most basic stuff?", "body": "As the title says, why am I forced to find a whole big party just so I can grind on weak low floors that have low chance of actually killing me.

Ok fine I'll put in a tl;dr scroll to the bottom, but you won't like it (probably).\n\nMages reigned before July 30th. 5 mages were the meta, any other option lowered speed and efficiency. This was a large problem. The intended thing to happen was that players would play EVERY CLASS AND NOT HAVE 2 PEOPLE ON THE SAME CLASS. (I mean, they made 5 classes for a reason right?)\n\nSuddenly, item nerfs happened. This caused a large issue because it wasn't items that made mage op, not the weapons, not the armour, not the class, not catacombs level, not.. Ok you get the idea.\n\nThe problem causing this was cps. (Clicks per second for anyone who for some reason doesn't now)\n\nRight clicking mage items (frozen scythe doesn't count) would deal large outputs of damage and there were no invincibility frames which in theory creates infinite dps.\n\n7 cps grants 1m dps\n12 cps grants 2.4m dps\n25 cps grants 4-5m dps\n(Damage is with bonzo staff pre-nerfed let me know if I got something wrong kindly and please don't scream)\n\nThere was a simple solution: Add a cps cap (in my idea its how many times can you click with a weapon per second) or a cap on how much damage a mob can take per second.\n\nThere are problems with these 2 solutions\n1. Yayayayayay carpal tunnel is fun yayayayay\n2. There goes archer damage, bye bye\n\nThe first solution is definitely more viable because\n1. Archer doesn't commit death (like the second solution)\n2. Small children taste good\n3. There won't be any disadvantages between low cps and high cps (provided its low enough)\n4. yum yum mhmhmh yes children very tasty\n5. Large outputs of cps can be controlled making mage a more balanced class and on par with other classes\n6. Weapons with cooldown can benefit\n\nHowever, with positives, comes negatives.\n\n\"In everything, there shall be both positives and negatives. Yea but except for... Remember like in- ok whatever I'll shut up. No but seriously like- ok fine.\" - Booster\n\n1. Makes cps virtually useless (if set low enough)\n2. Items without cooldown gets a nerf\n3. That's it lol my brain isn't big enough to think of more, pathetic I know.\n\nNow moving on to the pros and cons of the second solution\n\nPros:\n1. Balances mage damage like the first idea\n2. Low dps won't be affected (if set high enough)\n3. More control over big damage items (for admins)\n\nCons:\n1. There was once an Archer who did 2m damage per shot with his weapons, however, the dps cap came in with a max of 500k and now he does 4 times less damage. This is very sad, can we get 2 likes?!\n2. Pay tribute to the Archer first\n3. Ink wand (20 sec cooldown and does big damage)\n\nAs you can see, all players (who uses magic weapons) gets a nerf (sort of) in the first idea. In the second idea, if a player can reach such high dps, they are heavily nerfed and archer sort of just kinda, very sad and rants all over the forums (probably). Solution 1 is a superior idea because it will affects all players, not just a specific area making it fair for everyone.\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr read the thread, there isn't one here\n\n\nLet me know kindly if I got anything wrong"}, {"title": "[Suggestions] Dungeon Balancing", "body": "Some ideas I had\n\nDrops\n\n- If Milestone 4 is achieved, Bonzo's Mask has a higher chance to drop with level 6 Enchants\n-Ultimate books have a decreased chance if at least milestone 4 is not reached\n- Spirit Bow has a higher chance of dropping if a player hits Thorn more than 3 times using it\n\nClass Changes\n\n- Castle of Stone's effect is buffed to 10 seconds, but cooldown is increased by 15 seconds\n- Guided Sheep has a shorter cooldown\n-Archers \"stun bow\" now has aiming, as to balance it with Tank's \"stun potion\"\n\nGear Changes\n- Fixed Adaptive Blade activating abilities randomly\n- Changed Bonzo Staff to a Epic rarity\n- Adaptive Blade's +100 crit chance is now passive and is active without holding it out\n\n\nOther Changes\n- All blessings are buffed by 5%\n- Blessings are slightly rarer to find in chests\n-Fixed Bats being able to soft-lock into the ground and attack invisibly ( not sure if this is an actual bug or just happened to me)\n- When Spirit Bow is droppped , Thorn moves slower, making this fight much easier\n- Decreased the amount of mobs that can be summoned by Thorn by 8% to reduce lag\n\nthats all I have for now, leave changes down below"}, {"title": "why cant i put water bottles in my brewing stand?", "body": "title"}, {"title": "The Issue of The Mage Update (Floor 4 Release)", "body": "Yesterday, there was an update to Hypixel Skyblock that had many changes implemented to dungeons. Despite the launch not having a very clean start, the new abundance of content as well as class balancing changes were appreciated by much of the Skyblock community. But, even as classes reach a somewhat balanced state, the changes to mana and abilities in dungeons leave some people disappointed. (Mostly Mages)\n\n----Just as a warning before the rest of the Post, I myself am a mage in dungeons and thus cant guarantee an unbiased opinion, although I attempted not---- ----to take any single stand on this issue.----\n\n\u200bNow, before explaining my personal opinion of a way to improve the mage class I would like to first discuss the reason as to why the changes to the mage class were made in the first place. (Feel free to skip ahead.)\n\nThe Original Problem\u200bFrom the very introduction of magic damage scaling it was problematic to balance yet with the release of dungeons became impossible. Because new dungeons items gave triple or quadruple of the mana you could get previously (+ultimate wise essentially doubling mana) , the original drawback of high damage weapons with no cool-down, being the mana cost, vanished. This meant that people could achieve damage per second in the millions further amplified for people with an above average cps. As a result mage became the sole best class to play, even if you were playing a different class as the minor damage loss from changing the class perks would not greatly impact your ability to clear dungeons.\n\nThe Attempted Solution\u200b To attempt to solve this problem, the developers of Skyblock did the following:\n\n- Lower scaling of Frozen Scythe and Bonzo Staff\n- Give Pigman Sword a 5 second cooldown\n- Limited Bonzo Staff uses per second\n- Reduced mana regeneration\n- Gave mana regenerating abilities to arrows, melee, mage beam\n\n\nMy Opinion On These Changes\u200b\nThe lowered damage on Bonzo Staff and Frozen scythe were definitely needed as they were able to clear rooms far too quickly.\u200b\nAlthough not a terrible, the Pigman Sword nerf was too sudden and (at least temporarily) removed it from being a viable mage weapon for which many of them were enchanted (Such as Ult Wise) causing people to possibly loose many coins of value in the item.\u200b\nDespite the ability use cap being a solution the the nearly infinite dps problem with bonzo staff, this would be just as easily solved by increasing the mana cost and this solution would allow for more skill to be displayed in managing mana.\u200b\nThe final two points make the least sense as mages are meant to be at their strongest with a large supply of mana and it is somewhat counterproductive to make a mage fight with no spells to regain mana, as opposed to retreating until he regains mana or swapping to a less mana intensive damage dealing method.\u200b\n\nMy Ideas To Fix Mages\u200b\nInstead of imposing an ability usage cap or decreasing mana regeneration/redirecting it to other sources, it is possible to balance an ability almost fully based on mana. As a few examples, you could have a low mana cost weapon with a very low cooldown that also has low dmg but is far more mana efficient than lets say a Bonzo Staff. This item would not be the primary weapon but could be of far better use in long drawn out fights where the mage may run out of mana if using their Bonzo Staff. On the other side of the mana cost spectrum you might have a weapon that consumes all of your mana and deals mana based on that much like the Endstone Bow or Endstone Sword this item would not be effective to use for damage per second but could be used as an execute in a close encounter or to quickly eliminate a high priority mini boss.\n\nI could list many more ideas of how mage weapons could be balanced around mana cost such as area of effect damage, crowd control abilities, etc but I believe that I have made my point somewhat clear and would like to finish this discussion by hearing out your side of how the mage class should be designed.\n\nI have also made a poll to see if you would prefer for mages to use combat to regain mana or instead save mana for combat situations.\n\nThank you again for reading and have a great day.\n\n-TheLegendOfFury\n\n\nEdit: I see a few people voted for the current way mage is played, any chance you can explain why you like the current mage?"}, {"title": "Cant see healer circle", "body": "Hey whenever I use healer circle as mage I can't see it but my friends can see the green outline.
